This article explores tropes of ‘plant food masculinity’ throughout history, focusing on how while they have embodied different social, cultural, and political identities, they all serve as a tool to construct an archetypal masculine ideal. The analysis draws on a wide range of material from the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as a qualitative media analysis of #SoyBoy tweets posted between October 2010 and August 2018. It argues that, given that we live in a world steeped in ‘coloniality’ (Grosfoguel), it is no wonder that sexist and racist colonial-era tropes are alive and well today, packaged in a 21st-century digital culture form. In the digital politics of the alt-right, dairy milk has become a symbol for racial purity, connecting pseudo-scientific claims about milk, lactose tolerance, race, and masculinity. The term ‘soy boy’ provides a discursive counterpoint, relying heavily on colonial-era stereotypes of so-called ‘effeminate’ plant eating, often linked to Asian and other non-white cultures. The article concludes by arguing that for those working to reframe centuries-old norms and tropes related to race, sex, and humankind’s relationship to other animals, part of that work may take place online using the tools of social media and reappropriation of derogatory language. However, ultimately the power of social media to change norms and minds depends on the power of the social movements driving those changes; success is likely to only come through a robust anti-racist, color-conscious, and gender-conscious vegan movement (Harper).","2018-12-09","2023-02-17 17:07:01","2023-02-17 17:07:01","2023-02-17 17:07:01","","","","","","","From Rice Eaters to Soy Boys","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\K2J5YZCV\Gambert and Linné - 2018 - From Rice Eaters to Soy Boys Race, Gender, and Tr.pdf","","","altright; critical animal studies; cultural studies; dairy; food studies; gender; masculinity; media studies; milk; plant milk; racism; rhetoric; sexism; social media; soy; vegan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3298467","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ritual meals may have included special foods or different preparation in contrast with quotidian meals. In this study, we compare plant remains with isotope values from human remains to understand food practices at the site of Tenahaha in the Cotahuasi Valley of highland Peru (CE 850–1050). Built in a time of rapid social change, Tenahaha was a local mortuary center where people stayed for a few days to bury their dead and celebrate ancestors. Most food and drink appear to have been prepared and consumed communally, in contrast to the more private dining practices typical in villages of the era. C3 foods such as quinoa, tubers, and molle were ubiquitous at the site, suggesting a diet heavy in C3 foods. In comparison, stable isotope analysis of individuals buried at Tenahaha shows a diet dominated by C4 plants (maize) and animal products that may have been foddered on maize. A more maize-centric diet was common by the Middle Horizon in the central Andean sierra, replacing diets dominated by C3 foods. Although taphonomic and sampling concerns must be taken into account, the emphasis on C3 foods seen macrobotanically at Tenahaha may reflect a desire to consume more traditional foods while honoring the dead.","2020-03-01","2022-12-16 15:41:58","2022-12-16 15:41:58","2022-12-16 15:41:58","105095","","","115","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\2ZCZ6QZA\S0305440320300194.html","","","Cotahuasi; Macrobotanical; Middle horizon; Peru; Ritual and daily diet; Stable isotope; Tenahaha; Wari","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"HE72F6Y2","webpage","","Adams, Jay","Where does your water come from?","Denver Water","","","","https://www.denverwater.org/tap/where-does-your-water-come","Denver Water, which provides water to 1.5 million people across the metro area, relies on a system that collects rain and snow from across 4,000 square miles of mountains and foothills west of Denver. “Every year it’s helpful to have a large and diverse water collection system, because you never know how much snow we’ll see in Colorado and where it will fall,” said Nathan Elder, water supply manager at Denver Water. On an average year, the utility captures 290,000 acre-feet of rain and snowmelt in its collection system. That’s roughly 94 billion gallons of water — or enough to fill up nearly 157 Empower Fields at Mile High. The water flows down rivers and streams, then through a network of tunnels, pipelines and canals to treatment facilities in the Front Range to be cleaned for delivery to homes and businesses. Because most of the water comes from mountain snowmelt in the spring, water is stored in mountain reservoirs until it is needed. Construction on the elaborate reservoir storage collection system began in the early 1900s when Cheesman Dam was built along the South Platte River southwest of Denver. Over the years, additional dams and tunnels were built to capture and store more water for Denver’s growing population. Having a large and diverse collection system was critical to Denver’s growth because the city lies in a semi-arid climate. Denver Water’s collection system is centered on the state’s mountains and foothills, because that’s where most of Colorado’s precipitation falls. About 80% of Colorado’s snow and rain falls west of the Continental Divide. “The builders of the Denver Water collection system had to look to the mountains to ensure a reliable supply of water. There simply wasn’t enough moisture in the city to sustain the growing population,” Elder said. Image In Colorado, roughly 80% of the precipitation falls on the west side of the Continental Divide compared to 20% on the east side. This is why Front Range communities bring water over from the West Slope. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water collects around 50% of its drinking water from tributaries of the Colorado River on the west side of the Continental Divide. The rest of the utility’s drinking water comes from the South Platte River Basin on the east side of the Continental Divide. Denver Water relies on roughly 2% of the water used in the state to support around 25% of Colorado’s population. Image credit: Denver Water.Having a large geographic area to capture water is critical because it provides redundancy in times of drought, emergencies, infrastructure maintenance and improvement projects, according to Elder. One example of the need for diverse sources of water occurred in 2020, when Denver Water had to close the Roberts Tunnel for maintenance. Closing the tunnel meant no water could be brought to customers from Dillon Reservoir in Summit County. Dillon is the largest reservoir in Denver Water’s system. The Roberts Tunnel brings water from Dillon under the Continental Divide to the Front Range. With water in Dillon Reservoir out of reach until the tunnel’s maintenance project was finished, Denver Water had to rely on water coming down the South Platte River and from streams in Grand County. Another of Denver Water’s important water-carrying tunnels, the Moffat Tunnel, will be closed for maintenance in 2021, which means Denver Water won’t be able to access to water from Grand County during that project. The Moffat Tunnel carries water, collected from 36 Grand County streams, and funnels it under the Continental Divide to be stored in Gross Reservoir before going to treatment plants in the metro area. In times of drought, if the South Platte River Basin is experiencing dry conditions but collection areas on the West Slope are experiencing normal or above average precipitation, Denver Water is able to draw water from rivers and streams on the west side of the Continental Divide. Wildfires are another big concern for the utility. Eighty percent of Denver Water’s supply passes through Strontia Springs Reservoir, an area prone to wildfires like the 1996 Buffalo Creek and 2002 Hayman fires that impacted the reservoir and operations. These factors are among the reasons Denver Water is planning to expand Gross Reservoir. Denver Water’s storage capacity is imbalanced, with 90% of its storage capacity located in its South System and the remaining 10% located in its North System. The increased storage in Gross Reservoir would allow more water to be stored in Denver Water’s North Collection system provide additional redundancy in the utility’s ability to have a reliable water supply for customers. “Denver Water’s founders were not afraid to think big,” Elder said. “The foresight they had in the past greatly benefits Denver and the metro area now and will continue to help in the future.” The following maps break down the collection system and service area. Image Denver Water’s collection area covers 4,000 square miles on both sides of the Continental Divide. On average, the utility captures around 290,000 acre-feet of water from rain and melting snow every year — that’s over 94 billion gallons. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water stores water in 12 major reservoirs on both sides of the Continental Divide. Williams Fork and Wolford Mountain reservoirs are not used to store drinking water. Water collected and stored in those two reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin is released when needed to offset water that is diverted to the Front Range. Denver Water does not own Chatfield Reservoir, but stores water in it as part of an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water’s drinking water collection area contains eight river basins. The majority of the water supply comes from the Blue, Fraser and South Platte river basins. Having multiple basins creates a large area to collect water. The large collection area is critical in having a reliable water supply because some river basins see more precipitation than others. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water has two geographic areas where it collects water for its customers. The North System covers parts of Boulder, Clear Creek, Gilpin, Grand and Jefferson counties. The South System covers parts of Douglas, Jefferson, Park, Summit and Teller counties. Eighty percent of Denver Water’s supply comes from the South System while 20% comes from the North System. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water’s North System spans parts of Boulder, Gilpin, Jefferson and Grand counties. Water collected from 36 streams in Grand County on the West Slope travels through the Moffat Tunnel under the Continental Divide. Water flows down South Boulder Creek and is either stored in Gross Reservoir or sent through a canal down to Ralston Reservoir and on to a Denver Water treatment plant. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water’s South System captures water from the Blue and South Platte river basins. The Blue River is a tributary of the Colorado River on the West Slope of the state. Denver Water has rights to some of the water in the Blue River basin and stores it in Dillon Reservoir. From the reservoir, water can be delivered to the Front Range through the Roberts Tunnel under the Continental Divide. Water from the South Platte River is stored in a series of reservoirs running through Park, Douglas and Jefferson counties. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water has a water storage imbalance between its two collection systems with 90% of the reservoir storage in the South System compared to 10% in the North System. This storage imbalance creates vulnerability if there is a drought, mechanical issue or emergency that affects the South System. The storage imbalance is one of the reasons Denver Water is planning the Gross Reservoir Expansion Project. Image credit: Denver Water. Image Denver Water provides water to more than 1.5 million people who live in the city and county of Denver and several suburbs. The utility serves water to around 25% of Colorado’s population with roughly 2% of the water used in the state. The service area will not expand as part of the 2013 Colorado River Cooperative Agreement.

Stable isotope analyses of these humans have provided new information about the subsistence and society of individuals buried at Natfieh. Natfieh is today agriculturally productive and must have been so in antiquity with most of the foodstuffs having been produced locally. The long distance between Natfieh and the closest aquatic food source (Mediterranean Sea and Lake Tiberias) and the high cost of land transportation might be the reason for the low consumption of marine protein. The results agree with past research on the Roman diet showing that plants were the common source of food for the Romans and fish may have been restricted to elite members of the society.","2010","2023-03-15 15:31:25","2023-03-15 15:31:25","2023-03-15 15:31:25","645-652","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\2MRF9Q9Y\Al-Bashaireh et al. - 2010 - Paleodiet Reconstruction of Human Remains from the.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isotopic comparison of hair keratin and nail keratin from the same individual showed that there is no significant difference between hair and nail keratin in δ13C, but that nail keratin is on average +0·65‰ more enriched in δ15N than hair. Differences in amino acid composition between hair keratin and bone collagen may account for the carbon isotopic differences between the two proteins, and there is no significant overall carbon isotopic difference between hair and nail. However there are significant isotopic differences for nitrogen in the two pairings, that differences in amino acid composition and turnover times cannot explain.

Very few isotopic paleodietary studies have been conducted on samples from extremely arid conditions, nor have they had the luxury of including documentary and archaeological evidence of diet. Results indicate a shift in diet from the early cemeteries ('ein Tirghi and Kellis 1 cemeteries) where inhabitants consumed a diet composed mainly of C3 foods, to a diet that included millet (a C4 plant) by the early Roman period (Kellis 2 cemetery). Comparisons within cemetery populations, particularly Kellis 2, reveal sex and age differences in diet. Adult males were found to be enriched in 13C over females, indicating a heavier reliance on either millet or the flesh of cows and/or goat (which were found to be significantly enriched in 13C in comparison to the other animals). Infants' [delta] 13C and [delta]15N values were also found to be significantly elevated in comparison to adults. The enrichment in 13C suggests that supplementary foods of cow's and/or goat's milk was introduced at a very young age (before 6 months). Comparisons of [delta]13C values between archaeological and modern botanical remains suggest that towards the end of the occupation of the Roman period site of Kellis the agricultural fields were becoming increasingly laden with salt. This may have contributed to the ultimate demise and abandonment of this site during the 4th century AD. These findings suggest that by the Roman period the inhabitants of the Oasis had changed their dietary regime through the introduction of millet, reflecting changes in the economic and social structure of greater Egypt during this time period.","1999","2023-03-13 23:29:35","2023-03-13 23:37:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","McMaster University","","","","PhD thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Change in any one of these aspects of ancient lifeways can affect subsistence. Dietary patterns from this period are reconstructed by measuring stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in tissue samples from 146 mummies excavated from five sites in the Wadi Halfa area. On average, δ13C values of bone collagen, muscle, and skin indicate high consumption levels of C3 plants (presumably wheat or barley staples, mixed vegetables, and fruits) throughout the sequence. However, during the X-Group period (A.D. 350–550), there is a statistically significant increase in consumption of C4 plants (millet or sorghum), which are predominant in both the archeological record and in modern crop production for most of the Northern Sudan. The X-Group period was also associated with a low Nile and political and economic restructuring. Increased use of C4 plants on a seasonal basis is also indicated by shifting δ13C values along hair shafts for both X-Group and Christian periods. δ15N values suggest that the major source of protein for all time periods came from herbivorous animals.

Stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analysis provides another avenue to explore this question. A sample of 49 infant and juvenile human skeletal remains from the Kellis 2 cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt, was used to determine patterns of infant feeding and weaning. δ15N values indicate that supplementary foods were introduced at around 6 months of age, and that weaning was complete by 3 years of age. By 6 months of age, δ13C values become increasingly enriched over adult values, and reach peak enrichment at approximately 1.5 years of age. Beyond this age, δ13C gradually declines to approach adult values. This enrichment in infant δ13C values is indicative of consumption of 13C-enriched supplementary foods. Based on isotopic study of faunal and botanical remains from the ancient village of Kellis, we conclude that at approximately 6 months of age, infants were fed milk of goat and/or cow.

In this study, the data resultant from the combination of oxygen isotope ratios from bone apatite and nitrogen isotope ratios from bone collagen indicate that at least two individuals are not native to the Oasis, as shown by their lower nitrogen values and more positive oxygen isotopes, approaching values documented for residents of the Nile Valley and Nubia. The most isotopically distinctive individual is lepromatous, suggesting that he may have been exiled to the oasis from the Nile Valley.

Previous investigations of infant weaning patterns at the Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt, relied on cross-sectional isotope data. In this study, we re-examine this weaning pattern, using a simulated longitudinal approach, which does not require any assumptions regarding potential infant mortality biases. This involves examining the dental isotopic signatures of individuals who survived the weaning process. Stable isotope signatures from juveniles and adults (102 individuals, 297 teeth) were examined to reconstruct the weaning history of those that survived the weaning process. Both deciduous and permanent teeth were sampled. Homogenized enamel and dentin samples were isolated from each tooth and analyzed for δ13Cap and δ18Oap from the enamel and δ15Ncoll and δ13Ccoll from dentin collagen. We investigate differences between in utero versus postbirth, preweaning versus postweaning, and juvenile versus adult stable isotope values as reflected in the dentition. A random permutation procedure was used to test for statistically significant differences in stable isotope values between tooth types. Statistically significant differences were observed in all stable isotopes between permanent and deciduous teeth, and between early and later forming permanent teeth in δ13Cap and δ15Ncoll isotopes. These results indicate dietary change between in utero and postbirth, and changes occurring during the weaning period. These results provide a more comprehensive picture of infant weaning practices at Kellis and provide further support that complete weaning occurred by 3 years of age.

When combined with other archaeological information, stable isotope data can provide further insights into a wide array of anthropological and environmental issues such as weaning practices, disease processes and physiological stress, social stratification, animal husbandry practices, and climatic conditions. There are, however, current limitations of this method in the broad study region of Egypt and the Near East, most especially limitations surrounding a dearth of comparative and baseline data. By utilizing the IsoArcH database (https://isoarch.eu/database/), part of an initiative to advocate data sharing for bioarchaeological isotope researchers, we investigate the current isotope data available within the online repository.In addition, this compilation effort will benefit the entire archaeological community working in Ancient Egypt and the Near East by making isotopic data easily accessible online, available to anyone free of charge and available for re-use without restriction, except that attribution be given to the source. With 83 previous research outputs (totaling 2880 human samples and 1485 animal and plant samples) we find a wide range of isotopic data, from 6000 BCE to modern baseline samples.

Depending on exactly where the explosion occurs (above, on, or below the soil surface), bombturbation excavates a volume of soil from the site of impact, forming a crater and spreading much of the ejecta out as a surrounding rim of mixed, but sometimes slightly sorted, debris. Because such explosions are nonselective, that is, all of the material removed is mixed and redistributed, bombturbation is often a proisotropic form of pedoturbation-causing existing soil horizons to be entirely destroyed or intimately mixed. Although anthropogenically linked, bombturbation fits most appropriately under the existing pedoturbation category of ""impacturbation."" Unlike the rare instances of extraterrestrial (meteoroid) impacts, impacturbation by bombs and munitions is common worldwide; on some battlefields, it is so prominent that little or none of the original soil surface remains undisturbed. Indeed, many soils and landscapes that have undergone bombturbation are so pedogenically and topographically altered, largely because of the long-lasting craters left behind, that the soils within the craters may have shifted onto a new pedogenic pathway-something that many other forms of pedoturbation often cannot accomplish. We use examples, mainly from the World War I battle of Verdun (France), to illustrate crater and rim morphology and postbombturbation soil development and to highlight the importance of this newly defined pedoturbation process.","2006-11","2023-03-28 23:59:40","2023-03-28 23:59:40","2023-03-28 23:59:40","823","","11","171","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\YR9QZA8T\INTRODUCING__BOMBTURBATION,__A_SINGULAR_TYPE_OF.1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers employ chemical treatments to reduce contaminants that may interfere with the isotope ratios in hydroxyapatite. Chemical treatment should remove exogenous as well as non lattice-bound molecules without affecting the isotopic composition of the biogenic carbonate or introducing secondary carbonate material. However, there is growing concern that some of the most frequently used chemicals may alter biogenic isotope ratios, thus compromising isotope data. Despite a considerable body of literature, there is still no consensus as to which chemical treatment methods are “the best”. Here we test the isotopic effects of a suite of chemical experimental treatments on modern and fossil enamel carbonate, including six published protocols. We also test the degree to which carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in bone and dentine are affected by commonly used treatment chemicals. We conclude that treatment with hydrogen peroxide followed by Ca-buffered acetic acid yields the “best” results. This combination results in less extreme carbon, oxygen, and weight percent carbonate values compared to other treatments. Although sequential treatment with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and Ca-buffered acetic acid produces similar results for enamel, bleach is not recommended for tissues with a higher organic content, such as bone or dentine.","2014-08-14","2023-09-08 17:20:18","2024-03-12 14:19:44","2023-09-08 17:20:18","234-242","","","381","","Chemical Geology","To bleach or not to bleach?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\VSILMJTC\Crowley and Wheatley - 2014 - To bleach or not to bleach Comparing treatment me.pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\RDQEYCGK\S0009254114002447.html","","","Bone; Stable isotopes; Enamel; Bioapatite; Carbonate; Dentine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article considers what lessons can be learned from a series of inter-laboratory comparison exercises organised by the Forensic Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (FIRMS) network in terms of reference materials (RMs), the management of data quality, and technical limitations. The results showed that within-laboratory precision (repeatability) was generally good but between-laboratory accuracy (reproducibility) called for improvements. This review considers how stable isotope laboratories can establish a system of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA), emphasising issues of repeatability and reproducibility. For results to be comparable between laboratories, measurements must be traceable to the international δ-scales and, because isotope ratio measurements are reported relative to standards, a key aspect is the correct selection, calibration, and use of international and in-house RMs. The authors identify four principles which promote good laboratory practice. The principle of identical treatment by which samples and RMs are processed in an identical manner and which incorporates three further principles; the principle of identical correction (by which necessary corrections are identified and evenly applied), the principle of identical scaling (by which data are shifted and stretched to the international δ-scales), and the principle of error detection by which QC and QA results are monitored and acted upon. To achieve both good repeatability and good reproducibility it is essential to obtain RMs with internationally agreed δ-values. These RMs will act as the basis for QC and can be used to calibrate further in-house QC RMs tailored to the activities of specific laboratories. In-house QA standards must also be developed to ensure that QC-based calibrations and corrections lead to accurate results for samples. The δ-values assigned to RMs must be recorded and reported with all data. Reference materials must be used to determine what corrections are necessary for measured data. Each analytical sequence of samples must include both QC and QA materials which are subject to identical treatment during measurement and data processing. Results for these materials must be plotted, monitored, and acted upon. Periodically international RMs should be analysed as an in-house proficiency test to demonstrate results are accurate.","2013-03-01","2023-09-08 16:45:40","2023-09-08 16:45:40","2023-09-08 16:45:40","2799-2814","","9","405","","Anal Bioanal Chem","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry; Principle of identical treatment; Quality assurance; Quality control; Reference materials; Stable isotope ratio measurements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since its inception, the Forensic Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (FIRMS) Network has provided non-accredited ILEs to its members. Provision of an accredited proficiency testing (PT) scheme to ISO/IEC 17043:2010 was not possible until the administration of the scheme was outsourced to an accredited PT provider—in this case LGC Standards. LGC’s FIRMS PT scheme has been operating since 2013 and in 2015 it was included in their scope of accreditation to ISO/IEC 17043:2010 and it remains the only such accredited PT for stable isotopic analyses.  Each round of the PT scheme contains two materials that are of interest to forensic scientists. Participants report up to four isotope delta values for each material and the results of the PT scheme are interpreted using z- or z’-scores calculated using a standard deviation of performance assessment (SDPA) that was initially derived from the submitted data, but now have fixed values.  This paper presents and discusses results for the FIRMS PT scheme, including inter-laboratory comparability over time not just for individual laboratories but also for particular matrices that have been analysed in multiple rounds. The FIRMS PT scheme has also distributed the same physical material as earlier FIRMS ILEs providing a longer-term view. A number of interesting findings are presented highlighting the value of PT participation together with a discussion of the status of forensic bio-element stable isotope ratio analysis in the light of these outcomes.","2021","2023-09-08 15:59:19","2023-09-08 15:59:19","","100306","","","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/j.forc.2021.100306 MAG ID: 3120259964","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They include the adoption of maize agriculture, marine-focused diets amongst coastal hunter–gatherers, trophic level amongst Glacial-period modern humans and Neanderthals, and the use of savannah resources by early hominins in Africa. Particular attention is given to the progress made in addressing the challenges that have arisen out of these studies, including issues related to the routing of dietary nutrients.

We introduce the assignR r package, which provides a structured, flexible toolkit for isotope-based migration data analysis and interpretation using a widely adopted semi-parametric Bayesian inversion method. assignR bundles data resources and functions that support data interpretation, hypothesis-testing and quality assessment, allowing end-to-end data analysis with only a few lines of code. Tools for post hoc analysis offer robust, standardized methods for aggregating information from multiple individuals, assignment of individuals to a sub-region of the study area and comparison of potential regions of origin using odds ratios. Assessment tools quantify the quality and power of the isotopic assignments and can be used to test prototype study designs. The assignR package should increase the accessibility of isotopic geolocation methods. assignR supports flexible data sources and analysis decisions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, but also promotes standardization that will help foster increased consistency and comparability among studies and a more holistic understanding of animal migration. Lastly, assignR can help make isotope-based geolocation research more efficient by helping researchers plan projects to be optimally aligned with their research questions.","2020","2023-08-31 17:39:11","2023-08-31 17:39:11","2023-08-31 17:39:10","996-1001","","8","11","","","assignR","","","","","","","en","© 2020 British Ecological Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13426","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\ISE3CIBM\Ma et al. - 2020 - assignR An r package for isotope-based geographic.pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\SJDVADAF\2041-210X.html","","","stable isotopes; animal movement; assignR; avian migration; Bayesian methods; geographic assignment; r package","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plant hydrogen and oxygen isoscapes are therefore produced with a range of model sophistications and demonstrate some of the diversity of approaches to producing and utilizing isoscapes in general. Leaf water is central to much of plant H & O isoscape modeling. It affects the atmosphere at large scales by influencing atmospheric CO2 and O2 δ18O, and the biosphere at a range of scales through its influence on the isotopic composition of plant organic compounds. Leaf water isoscapes have therefore been produced as part of efforts to understand atmospheric gas isotopic composition and also have the potential to contribute to other areas where spatial variation in plant-derived organic compound isotope ratios is of interest. For example, improving our understanding of the isotope ratios of cellulose or n-alkanes improves their utility for paleoreconstructions. Spatially-explicit models of food isotope ratios may improve the use of animal isotope ratios to infer migration patterns. Finally, plant hydrogen and oxygen isoscapes can yield forensic information for a variety of products, including food, drugs, or other plant-derived materials.

Despite this method's frequent use across anthropological subdisciplines (and beyond), the present work represents the first attempt at gauging the effects of inter-laboratory variability engendered by differences in a) sample preparation, and b) analysis (instrumentation, working standards, and data calibration). Replicate analyses of a 14C-dated ancient human bone by twenty-one archaeological and paleoecological stable isotope laboratories revealed significant inter-laboratory isotopic variation for both collagen and carbonate. For bone collagen, we found a sizeable range of 1.8‰ for δ13Ccol and 1.9‰ for δ15Ncol among laboratories, but an interpretatively insignificant average pairwise difference of 0.2‰ and 0.4‰ for δ13Ccol and δ15Ncol respectively. For bone hydroxyapatite the observed range increased to a troublingly large 3.5‰ for δ13Cap and 6.7‰ for δ18Oap, with average pairwise differences of 0.6‰ for δ13Cap and a disquieting 2.0‰ for δ18Oap. In order to assess the effects of preparation versus analysis on isotopic variability among laboratories, a subset of the samples prepared by the participating laboratories were analyzed a second time on the same instrument. Based on this duplicate analysis, it was determined that roughly half of the isotopic variability among laboratories could be attributed to differences in sample preparation, with the other half resulting from differences in analysis (instrumentation, working standards, and data calibration). These findings have serious implications for choices made in the preparation and extraction of target biomolecules, the comparison of results obtained from different laboratories, and the interpretation of small differences in bone collagen and hydroxyapatite isotope values. To address the issues arising from inter-laboratory comparisons, we devise a novel measure we term the Minimum Meaningful Difference (MMD), and demonstrate its application.","2014-07-25","2023-08-30 18:03:06","2023-08-30 18:03:06","2023-08-30 18:03:06","e102844","","7","9","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\KHYZMATJ\Pestle et al. - 2014 - Quantifying Inter-Laboratory Variability in Stable.pdf","","","Archaeology; Isotope analysis; Stable isotopes; Isotopes; Collagens; Instrumentation; Paleoanthropology; Paleobiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It can be particularly useful in missing persons investigations to help establish an unknown's identity by potentially reconstructing an individual's geolocational history, determining the number of individuals present in a case, and linking/separating remains from commingled assemblages. In this review article, we explore several main themes related to the use of stable isotopes in postconflict forensic identification. First, we describe what stable isotopes are and how global isotopic variation arises in human tissues via natural processes and cultural practices. Next, we discuss the selection of appropriate human tissue samples for examination based on testable hypotheses. We provide guidance on the options that exist for isotope sample preparation, analysis, and data handling; and finally, we examine which sample quality measures and quality assurance approaches should be used in isotope data reporting and interpretation. These themes are primarily presented to help the isotope data consumer understand the benefits and limitations of the technique that might not be apparent when sending samples to and receiving results from a high throughput, contract isotope testing laboratory. Real world examples of forensic stable isotope ratio analysis are provided within the article to highlight many of the concepts, particularly in regard to identification applications.

Here we present the results of a small, preliminary isotopic study that was conducted in order to determine the geographical origin of 25 enslaved Africans who were buried at the Newton plantation, Barbados, sometime between the late 17th and early 19th century. In order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the slaves' origin, we used a combination of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium isotope analyses. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were determined in bone and dentinal collagen; oxygen and strontium isotopes were measured in tooth enamel. Results suggest that the majority of individuals were born on the island, if not the estate itself. Seven individuals, however, yielded enamel oxygen and strontium ratios that are inconsistent with a Barbadian origin, which strongly suggests that we are dealing with first-generation captives who were brought to the island with the slave trade. This idea is also supported by the fact that their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values differ markedly between their teeth and bones. These intra-skeletal shifts reflect major dietary changes that probably coincided with their enslavement and forced migration to Barbados. While it is impossible to determine their exact origins, the results clearly demonstrate that the slaves did not all grow up in the same part of Africa. Instead, the data seem to suggest that they originated from at least three different areas, possibly including the Gold Coast and the Senegambia.

Measurements of collagen concentrations in tooth and bone, atomic C:N ratios, and carbon and nitrogen concentrations in collagen of 359 historic and prehistoric African humans, and modern and prehistoric East African non-human mammals are described. Carbon isotope ratios of collagen lipids from four bones are also presented. Compared to bone, whole teeth have significantly lower collagen concentrations, lower carbon and nitrogen concentrations in collagen, and similar C:N ratios. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations and C:N ratios are relatively constant over a wide range of collagen concentrations. However, prehistoric specimens with very low collagen concentrations have highly variable C:N ratios, very low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in collagen, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios unlike collagen. At the transition from well-preserved to poorly preserved collagen the most reliable indicator of collagen preservation is the concentration of carbon and nitrogen in collagen. Concentrations of C and N drop abruptly by an order of magnitude at this transition point. These attributes provide simple criteria for assessing sample quality. Since collagen preservation can vary greatly within prehistoric sites, these attributes should be reported for each specimen. Use of purification procedures that remove acid- and base-soluble contaminants and particulate matter (carbonates, fulvic acids, lipids, humic acids, sediments and rootlets) are recommended. Wider adoption of these procedures would insure comparability of results between laboratories, and permit independent and objective evaluation of sample preservation, and more precise dietary, climatic, and habitat interpretations of collagen isotopic analyses.","1990-07-01","2023-11-06 11:26:22","2023-11-06 11:26:22","2023-11-06 11:26:22","431-451","","4","17","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\N2WUB2IN\030544039090007R.html","","","Paleodiet; Archaeology; Bone Chemistry; Bone Collagen; Bone Lipids; Carbon Isotopes; Diagenesis; Nitrogen Isotopes; Tooth Collagen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our investigation of sample treatment reveals that some methods commonly used to remove organic matter and secondary minerals induce significant isotopic offsets, particularly for oxygen isotopes in bone and dentin. Treatment with dilute sodium hypochlorite, to oxidize organic matter, followed by leaching with very dilute or acetate-buffered acetic acid, to dissolve secondary mineral contaminants, is recommended. Using this protocol, we explore the isotopic fidelity of different carbon- and oxygen-bearing components from individual fossil skeletons of Holocene humans and late Pleistocene mastodons and mammoths. Enamel hydroxylapatite yields reliable results, with low within-group isotopic variability and values that match those expected from well-preserved collagen from the same individual. In contrast, isotopic values from bone and dentin hydroxylapatite are more variable within groups of samples, and many specimens do not produce isotopic values consistent with those expected from collagen or enamel from the same individual. These results suggest that bone and dentin are unreliable source materials for isotopic analysis of structural carbonate, even for relatively young, mid-Holocene to Pleistocene specimens.","1997-05-01","2023-11-21 23:10:04","2024-03-12 14:19:55","2023-11-21 23:10:04","417-429","","5","24","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\H4J6VBHF\Koch et al. - 1997 - The Effects of Sample Treatment and Diagenesis on .pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\WSJ62QIN\S0305440396901260.html; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\ECDEYXHS\The_Effects_of_Sample_Treatment_and_Diagenesis_on_the_Isotopic_Integrity_of_Carbonate_in_Biogen.html","","","OXYGEN ISOTOPES; PALAEODIET; COLLAGEN; BONE; CARBON ISOTOPES; CARBONATE; DIAGENESIS; TOOTH DENTIN; TOOTH ENAMEL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in bioapatite carbonates are often measured after pre-treatment to study ancient diets and reconstruct past environments. It is common to pre-treat the samples to remove contributions from competing sources associated to organic material and secondary carbonates. Several chemical methods are described in the literature to pre-treat archaeological and fossil bioapatites (bone and teeth) for isotopic measurements with no consistency on their efficiency. Infrared and elemental analyses are combined in this study to highlight the effects of the different pre-treatments on the structure and chemistry of bioapatite. The different pre-treatments can variably affect the organic and carbonate contents of bioapatites, with some, such as sodium hypochlorite, apparently adding carbonate to the system. This may lead to a change in the biological isotopic signature of bioapatite carbonate, with effects on the correct interpretation of the results. According to the findings of our study, hydrazine hydrate seems to be the best chemical to remove organic matter without affecting the carbonate content of bioapatites, while the use of acetate buffered acetic acid solutions is recommended for removing adsorbed carbonates, when necessary. Sodium hypochlorite, instead, induces the adsorption of exogenous carbonates, while hydrogen peroxide does not remove organic matter efficiently even at high temperatures. These two chemicals should not be used to remove organic matter, especially from bone and dentine.","2015-12-06","2023-11-21 23:15:29","2023-11-21 23:15:29","2023-11-21 23:15:29","394-403","","","417","","Chemical Geology","Comparing bioapatite carbonate pre-treatments for isotopic measurements","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\HTXPXSU3\Snoeck and Pellegrini - 2015 - Comparing bioapatite carbonate pre-treatments for .pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\NWD3QH8Y\S0009254115300528.html","","","Bioapatite; Carbonate; FTIR; Organic matter; Pre-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reliability of these reconstructions is however dependent on the recovery of the biological signal and the removal of competing sources of carbon and oxygen isotopes, such as remaining organic material and secondary carbonates. Modern, archaeological and fossil bone and tooth specimens have been treated with different chemicals commonly used to pre-treat the samples with the aim of removing these competing sources of isotopes. Results highlight significant shifts in the isotope values of the samples tested, with different isotopic effects according to which pre-treatment was used. This has a clear impact on the data recovered, and may lead to misinterpretations of the results and inferred past diets and climates. The results of this study suggest that both hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite, the most commonly used oxidising agents employed to remove organic substance, have major problems: hydrogen peroxide is only partially efficient as organic removal agent and causes unwanted bioapatite dissolutions and isotopic shift, while sodium hypochlorite induces the incorporation of exogenous carbonates into the bioapatite, likely from the dissolution of atmospheric CO2 into the test tube. In both cases, there is an impact on the recovered isotope composition. Hydrazine hydrate, a third chemical for organic removal, has the lowest influence on the bioapatite isotopic composition, being also efficient at removing organic matter from bioapatites. The latter is recommended as an organic removal agent if such pre-treatment is deemed necessary. The use of acetic acid also causes isotopic shifts that seem independent on the removal of secondary/diagenetic carbonate, as also occurring in modern samples. Overall, our study clearly shows that any chemical treatment commonly used to remove unwanted contaminants from the bioapatite samples has also unpredictable, often significant effects on the pristine isotopic composition recovered, and corroborates the need for consistency in the pre-treatment of bone and teeth specimens. It also questions the necessity of removing organic matter at all from most skeletal samples prior to isotopic analysis.","2016-01-20","2023-11-21 23:19:40","2023-11-21 23:19:40","2023-11-21 23:19:40","88-96","","","420","","Chemical Geology","Comparing bioapatite carbonate pre-treatments for isotopic measurements","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\9QZWKB76\Pellegrini and Snoeck - 2016 - Comparing bioapatite carbonate pre-treatments for .pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\KYRLRNE6\S0009254115300851.html","","","C; O; Bioapatite pre-treatment; Bleaching; Isotopic shifts; Paleoclimate reconstructions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A standardized method for the stable isotopic analysis of skeletal carbonate has not yet been established, despite the importance of these data. In this study, significant differences in the stable oxygen isotope values of bones and dental enamel were observed, which arose due to instrument- and methodology-based differences. The same target archaeological samples were analyzed in three laboratories, and the stable isotope analyses were supplemented by Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements, which detected a strong OH− concentration-dependence in the stable oxygen isotopic shifts measured between the three laboratories. Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of reaction temperature and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) concentration on the oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate, both of which resulted in significant, though smaller δ18O changes than the OH-related δ18O change. As such, we suggest that the δ18O values of bone structural carbonate should not be included in anthropological interpretation and that the analysis of tooth enamel should be conducted at 70 °C using 102% H3PO4, in order to make the results comparable. Furthermore, carbonated hydroxylapatite (CHAP) reference materials with varied isotopic compositions should be developed in the near future.","2019-09-01","2023-11-22 16:36:05","2023-11-22 16:36:05","2023-11-22 16:36:05","104979","","","109","","Journal of Archaeological Science","Stable isotope analyses of the carbonate component of bones and teeth","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\IFIK2SDB\Demény et al. - 2019 - Stable isotope analyses of the carbonate component.pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\BS873LKZ\S0305440319300676.html","","","Archaeological bone and enamel; Carbonate-bearing hydroxyapatite; Fourier-transformation infrared spectroscopy; Stable isotope compositions; Structural carbonate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using sealed vessel reactions normalized to α25 = 1.01025 (the fractionation factor for calcite at 25°C), the apparent fractionation factor at 90°C (α*90) for pristine enamel ranged between 1.00771 and 1.00820, and between 1.00695 and 1.00772 for fossilized enamel. Apparent fractionation factors for common acid bath reactions are similar to those for sealed vessel reactions. A significant correlation exists between α*90 and F− content, suggesting that change in the acid fractionation factor may be related to the replacement of OH− with F− during fossilization of bioapatite. These results have important implications for making accurate comparisons between modern and fossil tooth enamel δ18O values, and for the uniformity of isotope data produced in different laboratories using different acid reaction temperatures.

However, the preservation of the skeletal remains must be preliminarily checked. About twenty-five years ago, a diagnostic method based on the oxygen isotope ratio in the phosphate, δ(O18/O16)Ph, and carbonate, δ(O18/O16)Carb, of bioapatite of modern mammals was proposed: for well-preserved samples, the δ(O18/O16)Ph and δ(O18/O16)Carb should plot near the regression line δ(O18/O16)Ph on δ(O18/O16)Carb obtained for modern mammals. In the last twenty years, techniques of analysis have changed. In the past, BiPO4 or Ag3PO4 were precipitated from dissolved bioapatite and analysed with the fluorination technique, whereas at present, temperature reduction (HTR) in a glassy carbon reactor with CO release is commonly used. Taking into account the HTR technique, for some modern mammals, we report a new δ(O18/O16)Ph + 1 on  δ(O18/O16)Carb + 1 regression line, and related dispersion of the data that, in addition to mineralogical and structural methods, may be used to select samples reliable for archaeological use. In the past, other similar regression lines on modern mammals were defined by several authors. However, statistical results indicate that data used for these regression lines cannot be pooled because the hypothesis of a similar elevation is rejected.","2022-09-24","2023-12-05 23:16:08","2023-12-05 23:16:08","2023-12-05 23:16:08","1204","","10","12","","Minerals","Oxygen Isotopes in Carbonate and Phosphate of Modern Mammal Bioapatite","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\8A5KILDQ\Iacumin et al. - 2022 - Oxygen Isotopes in Carbonate and Phosphate of Mode.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The high incidence of skeletal trauma characteristic of decapitation in those of Roman date makes this site unusual. A multi-isotope investigation of seven of these individuals was conducted to explore any link between intrusive burial practices and migration at one of Britain’s most northerly frontiers. Bulk collagen analysis provided a terrestrial, C3, dietary protein signal (mean δ13C −20.4‰ and δ15N+11.1‰), consistent with other Romano-British studies. However, the range of δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr and Pb isotopes indicate more diverse origins for the Roman individuals. These results suggest that decapitation burials were afforded to migrants to the Lothian area, but is not indicative of a common origin, implying that something more complex than a shared geographic childhood origin united these individuals. The possible association of these decapitation burials with a nearby 2nd century fort suggests that they may also represent some of the earliest examples of Roman decapitation burials to be found anywhere in Britain.","2020-02-01","2024-01-05 17:03:27","2024-01-05 17:03:27","","102075","","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/j.jasrep.2019.102075 MAG ID: 2998077732 S2ID: 6991586eebe93589b5b1c6eb8ee2fab6540ea7f7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary source information indicates that people were drawn to the city from around the Empire. Mortuary and archaeological material evidence also attest to its cosmopolitan nature and have long been used to characterize the people who are buried in Londinium and identify where they may have originated. Within the past decade, researchers have successfully applied isotopic analyses of strontium and oxygen to human remains from various settlements in Roman Britain in order to identify the migrant status of the inhabitants. Recent studies have highlighted the utility of lead isotopes for examining past mobility, particularly for the Roman period. The aim of this project, therefore, was to apply lead and strontium isotope analyses to dental enamel samples from twenty individuals excavated from Londinium. The results suggest that the geographic origins of the population of Roman London varied, comprising individuals local to Londinium and Britannia, but also from further afield in the Empire, including Rome. The findings from this study are a valuable addition to the growing stable isotope dataset that is helping to characterize the nature of migration in Roman Britain, and this has broader implications for interpreting the relationship of migration and identity in the province.","2016-02-01","2024-01-05 17:03:27","2024-01-05 17:03:27","","57-68","","","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/j.jas.2015.12.001 MAG ID: 2229521364 S2ID: e54fc306173ba4584fbf814dccee5e80e2f5dcc1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hoard, known as the “treasure of Marengo”, is one of the most important silver assemblages of late antiquity. It is dated to the second half of the 2nd century AD-first half of the 3rd century AD. The interpretation of the resulting isotopic data based on extended reference isotopic databases of lead/silver ores indicates that most of the analysed objects from Marengo form a rather homogeneus stock of silver metal having a signature affine to the mines of French Massif Central. One of the objects, a large belt with figures of divinity and heroes, was made of Iberian silver, and the Pb-Ag-Cu alloy present in the filling of the arm of a female statuette is rich in Sardinian lead. The results are discussed in terms of the known circulation of silver metal in the Roman Empire in the 1st and 2nd century AD. The lead isotope data are compared with available data on coeval Roman silver hoards (Notre Dame d’Allencon, Berthouville, Graincourt-les-Havrincourt, Boscoreale), circulating silver denarii, and Roman lead ingots rescued from shipwrecks in the Western Mediterranean sea. The role of the Iberian and French mines in the silver production from the 1st to the first half of the 3rd century AD is discussed.","2019-05-29","2024-01-05 17:03:27","2024-01-05 17:03:27","","4959-4970","","9","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/s12520-019-00851-2 MAG ID: 2947812873","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These activities are characterised by more than 70 sites comprising numerous dispersed slags. Related charcoal samples dated by 14C have yielded a medieval, ca. XI–XII th. C. age. Numerous ore deposits, now mostly old mine tailings, surround the granitic massif and are possible candidates for suppliers of the old smelting activities. In Western Europe, Pb–Ag mines were of primordial importance for the medieval monetary system. Mines were intensively coveted by Lords, Bishops and Kings, and their exploitation was strictly regulated by each owner. The scarcity of ancient manuscripts makes it impossible to use a historical approach to determine the ore source regions related to a given metallurgical activity.  The ore sources for this metallurgical activity were traced by comparing the Pb isotopic composition of slags and that of galena deposits surrounding the Mont-Lozere. The range of Pb isotopic compositions measured in slag samples is restricted and included in the field defined by galena from surrounding ores in Pb–Pb isotope diagrams. It is shown that, although direct tracing of the ore supplies is not straightforward, many ancient mine areas must be excluded, whereas some others seem highly likely. These old mines are not necessarily the closest to the smelting sites, suggesting that the choice of metal making location was constrained by several factors, including type of wood (here beech) and water proximity, but more importantly land ownership.","2006-02-01","2024-01-05 17:03:27","2024-01-05 17:03:27","","241-252","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/j.apgeochem.2005.09.005 MAG ID: 2027292559 S2ID: 7827f4a3c7a51d32538013a7f4a434f49424d5bd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Another important aspect of the study is the innovative use of electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) as a screening tool to greatly reduce the number of expensive lead isotope analyses needed for the study. The EMPA X-ray mapping for arsenic, antimony, copper, and silver narrowed the sample of curse tablets to those most likely produced from Tunisian ores; these tablets were then tested using thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) analysis. A total of 96 Roman lead curse tablets from Carthage, Tunisia were screened with EMPA and twenty selected for TIMS to determine the ore sources of the lead used to manufacture the tablets. Comparing the lead isotope ratios of twelve of the sixteen tablets most likely to be made of Tunisian lead to samples of Tunisian ores suggests that the Romans were mining lead in Africa Proconsularis and were not relying solely on imports.","2012-04-01","2024-01-05 17:03:26","2024-01-05 17:03:26","","970-983","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/j.jas.2011.11.015 MAG ID: 2091546518 S2ID: 72ba3c8f0ab4aec970ca5f5621362a7c445c4308","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These forebearers are overwhelmingly composed of white men to the exclusion of, as we argue here, pioneers of color. As a counter to prevailing Eurocentric narratives, we present the biographies of diverse contemporaries who were equally foundational to the field, including Black Americans, immigrants, and luminaries outside of the Western world. Common themes among their experiences involved discrimination, a lack of opportunities and recognition, and a biocultural and humanistic praxis that demonstrate modern discourses within the forensic anthropology community are not novel. Ultimately, this work shows that the historical foundations of forensic anthropology, in both the United States and globally, include a far more diverse cast of pioneers than what the prevailing literature suggests and should serve as a springboard from which our discipline can grow, both in its past and in its future.","2023-11-29","2023-12-14 15:53:09","2023-12-14 15:53:09","2023-12-14 15:53:09","","","","","","FA","Pioneers of Color","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\ALSG8LAL\Go et al. - 2023 - Pioneers of Color A Counternarrative of Foundatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These applications depend on the availability of reference data documenting isotopic values for individuals with known life history and on the comparability of data from reference and case work samples. Here we build on previous methodological research, which has largely focused on paleontological and archaeological samples, and conduct experiments using enamel from modern human teeth targeting three sample preparation variables (sample particle size, storage conditions, and chemical pretreatments). Our results suggest that differences in particle size affect the efficiency of sample reactions during pretreatment and analysis, with coarse particles giving reduced loss of enamel carbonate during acid pretreatments but producing slightly higher oxygen isotope values than fine particles during analysis. Data for samples stored in dry and ambient environments following pretreatment were indistinguishable, suggesting no exchange of oxygen between samples and ambient water vapor. Finally, chemical pretreatments with a range of commonly used reactants and conditions showed a pervasive, moderate oxygen isotope shift associated with acetic acid treatment, which may be caused by exchange of enamel hydroxyl groups with reagents or rinse waters. Collectively, the results emphasize the importance of methodological standardization to improve comparability and reduce potential for bias in the forensic application of tooth enamel isotope data.","2024-03-01","2024-02-15 20:49:26","2024-02-15 20:49:26","","193-201","","2","64","","Science & Justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tooth enamel; Stable isotopes; Forensic anthropology; Human identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reflections on Time, Temporality, and Pace in Engaged Scholarship","Temporality in Qualitative Inquiry","978-1-00-308350-4","","","","This chapter explores aspects of time, temporality, and pace across ten years of engaged scholarship in the North of England. Focusing on the experience of ongoing activist work with one youth charity - Unity Gym Project - the chapter seeks to show how time features in multiple ways, both experientially (in terms of temporal dispositions and pace) and practically (as a commitment, a resource, and a structuring feature that frames activities). Despite growing literature on practices of co-production, alongside references to a “temporal turn” in the social sciences, few authors have focused on matters of time in community-based qualitative studies. This chapter advances the methodological literature specifically in relation to community-based qualitative research by offering detailed reflections across three time-relevant domains: 1) “being there”; 2) balancing temporalities and synchronisation; and 3) time commitments, capacities, and expectations. The chapter concludes with a challenge to the temporalities increasingly associated with research in the fast-paced and increasingly time-pressured “neoliberal academy,” by considering instead the value of working at the speed of relationships; a pace that can be radically slow.","2021","2024-02-15 19:39:51","2024-02-15 19:39:51","","","","","","","","Radically Slow?","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 16","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\QAN8QT33\Mason - 2021 - Radically Slow Reflections on Time, Temporality, .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With those data, we applied both statistical and social network analysis (SNA) methods to explain variation in faculty placement as well as the network's overall structure.

Physical processes result in spatial variation of δ2H, δ18O in water across the landscape (so-called “isoscapes”) and provide the basis for hydrological, ecological, archaeological and forensic studies. Southern Africa is a globally important meeting point for ocean and climate systems, biological diversity and human societies, yet there is little information on the spatial variability of δ2H and δ18O in water across this important region. Here we present the first ground water and tap water isoscapes for southern Africa. We compare and contrast these two water resources, and consider how well global models of precipitation isotopes capture isotopic variation across South Africa. Ground water and tap water samples were collected from across South Africa, analysed for δ2H and δ18O, and used to generate interpolated δ2H, δ18O and deuterium-excess (d=δ2H – 8*δ18O) isoscapes. We found coherent spatial structure in δ2H, δ18O and d of ground water and tap water that could be predicted by a geostatistical model based on simple environmental parameters (elevation, mean annual precipitation, precipitation minus potential evaporation, distance to coast and modeled isotope ratio of precipitation). This spatial structure resulted in considerable differences in isotopic composition of water in many of the major wildlife reserves in South Africa, indicating a good potential for wildlife forensics in this region. δ2H and δ18O of ground water, and to a lesser extent tap water, reflected the δ2H and δ18O of long-term weighted annual precipitation at the two GNIP stations in South Africa. However, large discrepancies between modelled isotopic composition of precipitation and our ground water and tap water isoscapes, particularly at higher elevations, highlighted uncertainty in the accuracy of modelled precipitation isoscapes for this region. Increased spatial sampling of precipitation, especially for high elevation regions, and temporal sampling of ground and tap water would considerably aid isotopic studies in this region.","2014-10-01","2024-02-26 16:12:17","2024-02-26 16:12:17","","213-222","","","145","","Journal of Geochemical Exploration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","d-excess; Precipitation; Water resources; Wildlife forensics; δH; δO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we use a simple framework to calculate real interpretative difference (RID) values for collagen (“col”) and assess isotope data comparability for sample analysis (RIDanalysis) as well as sample preparation/analysis combined (RIDcombined). The RIDcombined values of 0.59‰ for δ13Ccol and 0.91‰ for δ15Ncol are similar to more complex, published calculations of inter-laboratory variability in the stable isotope analysis of skeletal remains, but they are easier to calculate and intuitively elegant. The RIDcombined as well as RIDanalysis values presented here allow users to examine multiple sources of inter-laboratory isotopic variation (preparation, analysis, and both together) in a two-step  process whereby a RID value is constructed and then tested.

Water used for maize production in these arid zones could have come from precipitation and runoff during the summer monsoon, from perennial streams and springs, or from stored soil water fed by snowmelt. The oxygen stable isotope ratio (δ18O) of summer and winter precipitation on the Colorado Plateau naturally differ by more than 10‰ providing a powerful tool for distinguishing winter- from summer-derived water sources used in cultivation of maize. We investigated whether variation in δ18O of potential source waters is preserved in the δ18O of cellulose (δ18Ocellulose) of maize cobs by growing four aboriginal and one modern maize variety in pots irrigated with water of known δ18O composition. The δ18Ocellulose values of cobs ranged from 26.8 to 36.4‰ (averaged within varieties) and were highly correlated with δ18O values of the source irrigation water (−15.8 to −8.2‰). Cob δ18Ocellulose from five archaeological sites on the Colorado Plateau in southeastern Utah ranged from 27.3 to 34.6‰, closely matching the range of values observed in experimental plants. A δ18Ocellulose model developed originally for tree rings was parameterized and applied to the archaeological maize cobs. The model indicated that monsoonal precipitation accounted for 0–20% of the moisture for archaeological cob samples from a site adjacent to a perennial stream and 43–98% for samples from an upland site, more distant from a perennial water source. These results reveal the potential for using δ18Ocellulose to investigate prehistoric irrigation practices and source water used for maize production in the American Southwest.","2005-06-01","2024-05-04 15:28:23","2024-05-04 15:28:23","2024-05-04 15:28:23","931-939","","6","32","","Journal of Archaeological Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\9WS3IPM9\S0305440305000270.html","","","Stable isotope; Corn; Irrigation; Source water; Summer monsoon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model predicts the isotope ratios of tree-rings, incorporating both humidity and source water environmental information. Components of the model include (1) hydrogen and oxygen isotope effects associated with leaf water enrichment; (2) incorporation of leaf water isotope ratio values into photosynthetic carbohydrates along with the biochemical fractionation associated with autotrophic synthesis; (3) transport of exported carbohydrates (such as sucrose) from leaves to developing xylem in shoots and stems where cellulose is formed; (4) a partial exchange of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in carbohydrates with xylem sap water during conversion into cellulose; and (5) a biochemical fractionation associated with cellulose synthesis. A modified version of the Craig–Gordon model for evaporative enrichment adequately described leaf water δD and δ18O values. The leaf water model was robust over a wide range of leaf waters for both controlled experiments and field studies, far exceeding the range of values to be expected under natural conditions. The isotopic composition of cellulose was modeled using heterotrophic and autotrophic fractionation factors from the literature as well as the experimentally derived proportions of H and O that undergo exchange with xylem water during cellulose synthesis in xylem cells of tree-rings. The fraction of H and O from carbohydrates that exchange with xylem sap water was estimated to be 0.36 and 0.42, respectively. The proportions were based on controlled, long-term greenhouse experiments and field studies where the variations in the δD and δ18O of tree-ring cellulose were measured under different source water isotopic compositions. The model prediction that tree-ring cellulose contains information on environmental water source and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (related to relative humidity) was tested under both field and greenhouse conditions. This model was compared to existing models to explain cellulose isotope ratios under a wide range of source water and humidity conditions. Predictions from our model were consistent with observations, whereas other models showed large discrepancies as soon as the isotope ratios of source water and atmospheric water deviated from each other. Our model resolves the apparently conflicting and disparate interpretations of several previous cellulose stable isotope ratio studies.","2000-01-01","2024-05-02 17:43:18","2024-05-02 17:43:18","2024-05-02 17:43:18","21-35","","1","64","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\V5YGG265\S0016703799001957.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monthly environmental measurements included temperature and humidity along with measurements of the isotope ratios in atmospheric water vapor, stream, stem, and leaf water. Small riparian trees used only stream water (both δD and δ18O of stem and stream water did not differ), but δ values of both atmospheric water vapor and leaf water varied substantially between months. Differences in ambient temperature and humidity conditions between sites contributed to substantial differences in leaf water evaporative enrichment. These leaf water differences resulted in differences in the δD and δ18O values of tree ring cellulose, indicating that humidity information was recorded in the annual rings of trees. These environmental and isotopic measurements were used to test a mechanistic model of the factors contributing to δD and δ18O values in tree ring cellulose.

[Radiation and Environmental Biophysics 11 (1974) 41]) that can be used to calculate the isotopic composition of the source-water (and thus of precipitation) that a tree used during the growing season. The calibration of the model was accomplished by comparing a previously measured oxygen isotope tree ring chronology from Central Switzerland with the Swiss Network for Isotopes in the Hydrologic Cycle station at Bern from 1971 to 1995 and integrating temperature, relative humidity data, and ring-width. In particular, our efforts focused on understanding the significance of the dampening factor f, which we relate to changes in humidity, and its variability over both the calibration period (1971 to 1995) and the study period (1913 to 1995). Our results indicate that f (ranging between 0.27 to 0.49) is variable, based on correlation with relative humidity, average daily temperature and ring width index. Using this model, we have constructed a record of the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation during the growing season (May through September) for the last century in central western Europe.

Recent advances make the approach viable for non-specialist laboratories. The relevant literature is, however, spread across several disciplines, with common problems approached in different ways. Here we provide the first overview of isotope dendroclimatology, explaining the underlying theory and describing the steps taken in building and interpreting isotope chronologies. Stable carbon isotopes record the balance between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, dominated at dry sites by relative humidity and soil water status and at moist sites by summer irradiance and temperature. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios record source water, which contains a temperature signal, and leaf transpiration, controlled dominantly by vapour pressure deficit. Variable exchange with xylem (source) water during wood synthesis determines the relative strength of the source water and leaf enrichment signals. Producing long Holocene chronologies will require a change in emphasis towards processing very large numbers of samples efficiently, whilst retaining analytical precision. A variety of sample preparation and data treatment protocols have been used, some of which have a deleterious effect on the palaeoclimate signal.

Dentine incremental growth structures are complex, however, and current approaches that apply horizontal sectioning of demineralized tooth halves or quarters risk combining multiple growth layers and may include unwanted cementum or secondary dentine. They also require destruction of large parts of a tooth. Here, we present a less destructive and relatively straightforward protocol that reduces damage, increases temporal resolution, and improves the accuracy of age-alignment between individuals. Material and methods We outline a protocol that includes the sampling of small (1 mm diameter) cylindrical plug transects from a thin section, along with an age-alignment scheme predicated on average growth rates for dentine areas. Results and discussion The proposed protocol is readily applicable and more anatomically sensitive than horizontal slicing. Micro-samples are smaller (in both length and depth), hence minimizing temporal overlap and avoid directions that may contravene growth pattern. They completely avoid areas where secondary and tertiary dentine or cementum can be deposited. Age-alignment is improved by using growth ratios of anatomical tooth zones. Conclusion This method minimizes destruction, enables finer temporal resolution and facilitates data comparison. It can be readily combined with fluorescence imaging-based or other pre-screening methods of dentine collagen preservation.","2020","2024-06-03 16:31:54","2024-06-03 16:31:54","2024-06-03 16:31:54","776-783","","4","173","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 The Authors.

Current methods of sampling permanent teeth using 1 mm increments provide temporal resolution of 6–9 months at best depending on the tooth chosen. Although this gives sufficient sample sizes for reliable analysis by mass spectrometry, sectioning the dentine across the incremental structures results in a rolling average of the isotope ratios. A novel method of incremental dentine collagen sampling has been developed to decrease the collagen increment size to 0.35 mm along the incremental structures, thus reducing averaging and improving the temporal resolution of short-term changes within the δ13C and δ15N values. Methods This study presents data for a MicroMill-assisted sampling method that allows for sampling at 0.35 mm width × 1 mm depth increments following the incremental growth pattern of dentine. A NewWave MicroMill was used to sample the demineralised dentine section of modern donated human third molars from Sudan and compared to data from the same teeth using the 1 mm incremental sectioning method 2 established by Beaumont et al. Results The δ13C and δ15N isotopic data showed an increased temporal resolution, with each increment providing data for 2–4 months of dentine formation. Conclusions The data show the potential of this method for studying dietary reconstruction, nutritional stress, and physiological change with greater temporal resolution potentially to seasonal level and with less attenuation of the δ13C and δ15N values than was previously possible from human dentine.","2022","2024-06-03 16:33:36","2024-06-03 16:33:36","2024-06-03 16:33:36","e9305","","13","36","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2022 The Authors.

Wooller               et al               . examined isotopes collected from the tusk of a 17,000-year-old mammoth to elucidate his movements from birth to death.

Strontium is a common trace element in soils, rocks, and water and is ubiquitous in groundwater with detectable concentrations in 99.8% of samples (n = 4,824; median = 225 μg/L). Concentrations in 2.3% of samples exceeded the 4,000 μg/L health-based screening level. The relative importance of controlling factors on Sr concentration are spatially variable and partly dependent on the type of groundwater well. Three case settings illustrate controls on Sr concentration. For drinking-water supply wells, most high concentrations (>4,000 μg/L) were measured in samples from carbonate aquifers that resulted from water-rock interaction with Sr-bearing rocks and minerals. High Sr concentrations from monitoring wells were more common in unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers in arid or semi-arid setting where shallow groundwater is affected by irrigation and evaporative concentration of dissolved constituents in combination with lithologic or applied Sr sources. Upwelling saline groundwater is also a source of Sr in some locations. Total dissolved solids concentration is an indicator of high Sr in all settings. An estimated 2.2 million people in the conterminous U.S. are potentially supplied water from public-supply wells with high Sr concentration, ~86% of whom use carbonate aquifers (with more than half supplied by the Floridan aquifer system). An additional 120,000 people are potentially supplied high-Sr-concentration water from domestic wells, more than half of whom (~58%) are in Texas. This study markedly expands the coverage of previous surveys of Sr in groundwater and is of interest given potential adverse human-health effects related to elevated concentrations of Sr and consideration of Sr for drinking-water regulation. Case settings with elevated Sr described for U.S. groundwater are likely indicative of settings and processes affecting Sr concentration in groundwater globally.","2021-03-01","2024-06-05 16:36:48","2024-06-05 16:36:48","2024-06-05 16:36:48","104867","","","126","","Applied Geochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\2MTBLNJT\S0883292720303590.html","","","Strontium; Groundwater","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model, which predicts hair isotopic composition as a function of drinking water, bulk diet, and dietary protein isotope ratios, explains >85% of the observed variation and reproduces the observed slopes relating the isotopic composition of hair samples to that of local drinking water. Based on the geographical distributions of the isotope ratios of tap waters and the assumption of a “continental supermarket” dietary input, we constructed maps of the expected average H and O isotope ratios in human hair across the contiguous 48 states. Applications of this model and these observations are extensive and include detection of dietary information, reconstruction of historic movements of individuals, and provision of region-of-origin information for unidentified human remains.","2008-02-26","2024-06-28 18:42:22","2024-06-28 18:42:22","2024-06-28 18:42:22","2788-2793","","8","105","","Proc.

We analyzed 292 incremental sections from 46 second and third molars to explore dietary patterns between the ages of 4.5 and 23.5 years. Results indicate that individuals consumed more, or higher trophic level, terrestrial-based animal proteins as they aged. Sex-based comparisons also suggest that males and females consumed isotopically similar diets for most of their childhood; however, around age 16.5, males exhibited significantly lower δ15N values than females with a large effect size (U = 21.0, p = 0.012, g = 1.3). This difference in diet occurs during an important age-based social change in the Roman life course, as individuals transitioned from childhood (pueritia) to adolescence (adulescentia). When the isotopic data are combined with literary and archaeological evidence, it suggests that this was the point when men and women diverged in their life course trajectories. Young men were expected to begin apprenticeships or military duty away from home, whereas women were kept close to their family home at this age. The isotopic results suggest these gendered experiences may have influenced dietary choices or access to foods at Lisieux-Michelet. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of using permanent dentition in adult remains to explore childhood experiences and provide new insights into child and adolescent diet and gendered experiences in the context of the Late Roman Empire.","2021","2024-06-27 17:08:37","2024-06-27 17:08:37","2024-06-27 17:08:35","1226-1236","","6","31","","","Child and adolescent diet in Late Roman Gaul","","","","","","","en","© 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/oa.3033","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\SN8HNQC8\Avery et al. - 2021 - Child and adolescent diet in Late Roman Gaul An i.pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\36FFWQYS\oa.html","","","childhood; adolescence; Paleodietary analysis; Roman empire; social age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study uses a multiproxy approach, involving concentrations of major ions, and               87               Sr/               86               Sr of the dissolved phases in seasonally collected river water and groundwater samples from the Lower Mahanadi Basin to investigate the sources of ions, the Cl-enrichment in the river water, the influences of the man-made structures like the Naraj Barrage, and the role of fertilizers on the chemistry of the river water. This study also provides the first estimate of the radiogenic Sr-flux of the Mahanadi River to the Bay of Bengal. Both inverse and forward models were used to evaluate the contributions of different sources to the dissolved ions of the Mahanadi River over different seasons. The results suggest that even in the predominantly silicate watershed of the Lower Mahanadi River, the riverine chemistry is modulated primarily by carbonate dissolution farther upstream followed by silicate weathering although, the contributions vary seasonally. The Naraj Barrage, which divides the main channel of the Lower Mahanadi River into several distributaries marks a divide between the less polluted upstream and the more polluted downstream. The radiogenic               87               Sr/               86               Sr of the Mahanadi River water can be explained by mixing of four endmembers: Proterozoic carbonates, Archean silicates, rainwater, and fertilizers. The dominance of agricultural input during monsoon is consistent with high loadings of nitrates and phosphates used as fertilizers in the Mahanadi River basin along with a strong positive relationship between phosphate concentrations and               87               Sr/               86               Sr of the river water samples.

The groundwater composition of the Lower Mahanadi Basin is modulated by the mixing of four endmembers, viz. weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks, Bay of Bengal seawater, and fertilizer inputs. The groundwater samples of the Mahanadi basin show an average Sr concentration of 5.45 μmol/l and an average               87               Sr/               86               Sr of 0.71772.","2022-04-19","2024-06-05 21:27:55","2024-07-11 15:40:41","2024-07-10 14:41:23","846438","","","4","","Front.

We analysed surface and ground water from the Daly River catchment in the wet–dry tropics of northern Australia over 2 years.

This paper focuses on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport and its δ               13               C isotopic signature. The δ               13               C               DIC               values vary between −12·8 and −1·8‰ and allow one to distinguish two river groups: (i) the Colorado, Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, which display the highest values and the lowest seasonal variations; (ii) the Deseado, Coyle, Chico and Gallegos, which show the lowest values and the highest seasonal variations. For the first group, δ               13               C               DIC               is mainly controlled by important exchanges between the river waters and atmospheric CO               2               , due to the presence of lakes and dams. For the second group, δ               13               C               DIC               also appears to be controlled by the oxidation of organic carbon, showing a negative relationship between δ               13               C               DIC               and the dissolved organic carbon. These biogeochemical processes interfere with the contribution of carbonate and silicate weathering to the riverine DIC and do not allow use of δ               13               C               DIC               alone to distinguish these contributions.                                         The annual DIC flux exported by Patagonian Rivers to the South Atlantic Ocean averages 621 × 10               9               g. of C, i.e. a specific yield of 2·7 g m               −2               year               −1               .

Results from a leaching and exchange experiment demonstrated that non‐ideal storage conditions did not prohibit Sr isotope analysis of previously archived water samples stored in glass. Tap water samples were analyzed via multi‐collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which was preceded by a novel, automated, in‐line Sr purification method. Measured tap water               87               Sr/               86               Sr was compared to expected               87               Sr/               86               Sr for collection location, which was predicted using four published isotope landscape (isoscape) models: age of bedrock (bedrock model), age plus major and minor lithology of bedrock (major bedrock model), weathering of Sr from rock (local water model), and surface fluxes within watershed (catchment model). The geologic history of the geographic regions represented by collected tap waters was diverse and we therefore expected significant covariation in measured and modeled               87               Sr/               86               Sr values. Tap water exhibited large ranges in both Sr concentration (0–1.9 mg/L) and               87               Sr/               86               Sr (0.7037–0.7320). Measured tap water               87               Sr/               86               Sr ratios were significantly and positively correlated with predictions based on bedrock and catchment models. However, these bedrock and catchment models explained relatively little of the tap water Sr isotopic variation (∼10% and 17%, respectively), suggesting that the factors affecting drinking water               87               Sr/               86               Sr are complex and more numerous than the variables included in current water models. This could be due to the reliance of some municipal water systems on groundwater, rather than surficial water sources; the natural movement of water across distinct geologic gradients; and/or the managed transport of water from source to point‐of‐use. Although published isoscape models for predicting Sr isotopic variation within the continental USA are reasonable approaches for estimating surface water               87               Sr/               86               Sr, additional efforts are needed to develop a prediction model specifically for tap water               87               Sr/               86               Sr.","2012-07","2024-07-10 14:42:28","2024-07-10 14:42:28","2024-07-10 14:42:28","1-17","","7","3","","Ecosphere","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\AHL94NI2\Chesson et al. - 2012 - Strontium isotopes in tap water from the cotermino.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Sr concentration follows that of Ca and Mg with Sr/Ca and Sr/Mg ratios similar to that of Deccan basalts, suggesting that all these alkaline earths are released to waters nearly congruently from the Deccan basalts during chemical weathering. The               87               Sr/               86               Sr range from 0.70614 to 0.70986, within that reported for the Deccan basalts. The dissolved Sr flux from the Deccan calculated from the measured data is ∼1.35 × 10               8               moles yr               −1               , ∼0.4% of the global riverine flux, which is nearly the same as the proportion of area covered by Deccan basalts relative to the global drainage. The flux, however, is a factor of ∼3 lower than that reported for the Narmada‐Tapti‐Wainganga (NTW) rivers draining the northern Deccan. This difference in Sr flux among rivers draining the various regions of Deccan could be natural spatial/temporal variations and/or due to supply of Sr to NTW rivers from nonbasaltic sources. Model calculations on the role of emplacement and weathering of Deccan on marine Sr isotope evolution around KTB and late Tertiary show that Deccan basalts can be an important contributor to the decline in               87               Sr/               86               Sr during these periods. It is shown that to account for the pre‐KTB dip in               87               Sr/               86               Sr, the flux requirement from Deccan at that time would have to be several times the contemporary flux with               87               Sr/               86               Sr of 0.705–0.708. Considering that the area of Deccan at KTB was about thrice the present area and that the weathering rate of Deccan basalts may have been much higher in early stages following eruption, such high fluxes at about KTB seem feasible. The disproportionately higher flux requirement for Sr is similar to that invoked to explain the pre‐KTB decrease in               187               Os/               188               Os.

One approach to migration studies, strontium isotope (               87               Sr/               86               Sr) analysis, has emerged as an effective technique. Until now, however, this method has not been applied to the Inca heartland region of Cuzco, Peru. In this study, we use strontium isotope analysis to examine patterns of prehistoric migration in the Cuzco Valley. Human dental enamel samples from the Cuzco Valley site of Chokepukio are analyzed and compared to the local               87               Sr/               86               Sr signature established through faunal specimens. Though tentative due to a small sample size, the isotope results do not provide evidence for migration at this site from the time periods preceding the rise of the Inca Empire (200 B.C. to A.D. 1400). In contrast, there is substantial evidence for migration during the time of Inca imperialism (A.D. 1400–1532). Among these migrants, variation in 87Sr/86Sr values suggests that individuals emigrated from geologically diverse locations, while sex differences in the migrant group include a higher percentage of females and a greater diversity in female               87               Sr/               86               Sr values.

Paleoanthropologically, reliance on such habitats informs behavioral and ecological reconstructions; for example, gallery forest habitats likely played a critical role in the transition from ape to hominin in the early Pliocene and may represent a preferred habitat for the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. Direct indicators for gallery forest habitats preference are lacking. The objective of this article is to assess whether strontium isotope ratios are a reliable indicator of habitat preference for fauna living in and around gallery forests.                                         Materials and methods               We report bioavailable strontium isotope ratios from the Mugiri River, its tributaries, and its gallery forest (Toro‐Semliki Wildlife Reserve, southwestern Uganda), and compare them to surrounding savanna‐grassland values. We compare these environmental values to strontium isotopes ratios in faunal tooth enamel to determine if habitat preferences are accurately reflected.                                         Results               Gallery forest and savanna‐grassland vegetations have significantly different strontium isotope ratio profiles. We trace these isotopic differences to the influence of the Mugiri tributaries, which originate on Paleoproterozoic gneiss deposits on top of the surrounding escarpments. These isotopic differences in vegetation are mirrored in the tissues of fauna with habitat preferences for either the gallery forest or the surrounding grasslands.                                         Discussion               This research demonstrates the potential of strontium isotope ratios to identify habitat preferences in modern or fossil fauna under proper geologic variability. It provides a methodological model for future studies seeking to reconstruct habitat preferences in early hominins.","2019-12","2024-06-05 21:29:14","2024-07-11 15:41:56","2024-07-10 14:43:16","551-564","","4","170","","American J Phys Anthropol","Detecting riparian habitat preferences in “savanna” chimpanzees and associated Fauna with strontium isotope ratios","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although lithological maps can provide a guideline, estimations of bioavailable               87               Sr/               86               Sr are often necessary, both in qualitative estimates of local strontium isotope “catchments” and for informing/refining isoscape models. Local soils, plants and/or animal remains are commonly included in bioavailability studies, although consensus on what (and how extensively) to sample is lacking. In this study, 96 biological samples (plants and snails) were collected at 17 locations spanning 6 lithological units, within a region of south-west France and an area with a high concentration of Paleolithic archaeological sites. Sampling sites aligned with those from a previous study on soil bioavailable strontium, and comparison with these values, and the influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables, was explored. Data confirm a broad correspondence of plant and snail               87               Sr/               86               Sr values with lithological unit/soil values, although the correlation between expected               87               Sr/               86               Sr values from lithology and bioavailable               87               Sr/               86               Sr ratios from biological samples was higher for plants than for snails. Grass, shrub and tree               87               Sr/               86               Sr values were similar but grasses had a stronger relationship with topsoil values than trees, reflecting differences in root architecture. Variability in               87               Sr/               86               Sr ratios from all plant samples was lower for sites located on homogeneous geological substrates than for those on heterogeneous substrates, such as granite. Among environmental and anthropogenic variables, only an effect of proximity to water was detected, with increased               87               Sr/               86               Sr values in plants from sites close to rivers originating from radiogenic bedrock. The results highlight the importance of analyzing biological samples to complement, inform and refine strontium isoscape models. The sampling of plants rather than snails is recommended, including plants of varying root depth, and (if sample size is a limitation) to collect a greater number of samples from areas with heterogeneous geological substrates to improve the characterizations of those regions. Finally, we call for new experimental studies on the mineralized tissues of grazers, browsers, frugivores and/or tree leaf feeders to explore the influence of               87               Sr/               86               Sr variability with soil profile/root architecture on               87               Sr/               86               Sr values of locally-feeding fauna.","2020-12-15","2024-06-05 21:28:16","2024-07-11 15:41:14","2024-07-10 14:43:31","579473","","","8","","Front.

The streams drain terrain that is dominated by Mesozoic granitoids of the Sierra Nevada batholith but that also contains irregularly distributed roof pendants of Paleozoic metasedimentary sequences. Mass balance modeling indicates that plagioclase feldspar weathering is the dominant contributor to stream chemistry and that carbonate dissolution is also a significant source of solutes for most streams. The calculated ratio of plagioclase to carbonate is highly sensitive to the assumed weathering product of plagioclase (kaolinite versus smectite), and we suggest that the importance of carbonate could be exaggerated in cases where only the plagioclase‐to‐kaolinite reaction is considered.

The overall Sr budget of the watershed is determined by the relative contributions of carbonate dissolution and plagioclase feldspar weathering and is dominated by reactions related to pyrite oxidation and hydrothermal fluid input from just two subbasins. The impact of these processes needs to be considered when modeling regional and global riverine Sr budgets. Climate‐related shifts in the relative importance of silicate mineral weathering reactions appear to be only second‐order effects on a regional scale.","2002-08","2024-07-10 14:43:52","2024-07-10 14:43:52","2024-07-10 14:43:52","","","8","38","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\3SN3WDE8\Pretti and Stewart - 2002 - Solute sources and chemical weathering in the Owen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We systematically investigated the Sr isotopic characteristics of a small silicate watershed, the Xishui River a tributary of the Yangtze River, and a small carbonate watershed, the Guijiang River a tributary of the Pearl River. The results show that the two rivers have uncommon Sr isotopic characteristics compared with most small watersheds. Specifically, the silicate watershed (Xishui River) has relatively high Sr concentrations (0.468 to 1.70 μmol L−1 in summer and 1.30 to 3.17 μmol L−1 in winter, respectively) and low 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.708686 to 0.709148 in summer and 0.708515 to 0.709305 in winter). The carbonate watershed (Guijiang River) has low Sr concentrations (0.124 to 1.098 μmol L−1) and high 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.710558 to 0.724605).  As the 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the Xishui River are lower than those in seawater, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater will decrease after the river water is transported to the oceans. Previous studies have also shown that some basaltic watersheds with extremely high chemical weathering rates reduced the seawater Sr isotope ratios. In other words, river catchments with high silicate weathering rates do not certainly transport highly radiogenic Sr into oceans. Therefore, the use of the variations in the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio to indicate the continental silicate weathering intensity may be questionable.  In the Guijiang River catchment, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of carbonate rocks and other sources (rainwater, domestic and industrial waste water, and agricultural fertilizer) are lower than 0.71. In comparison, some non-carbonate components, such as sand rocks, mud rocks, and shales, have relatively high Sr isotopic compositions. Moreover, granites accounted for only 5% of the drainage area have extremely high 87Sr/86Sr ratios with an average of greater than 0.8. Therefore, a few silicate components in carbonate rocks obviously increase the Sr isotopic compositions of the river water.","2014-02-13","2024-06-05 21:33:45","2024-07-11 15:44:37","2024-07-10 14:44:02","559-573","","2","18","","Hydrol.

The site contains several graves with metal artefacts that originated in other parts of Central and Western Europe, and therefore these could be interpreted as being the graves of non‐local individuals. The purpose of this study was to investigate this possibility through the application of isotopic analysis. The ratios of strontium and oxygen isotopes in human enamel reflect the geological origin of food and drinking water consumed during enamel formation in early life stages. Additionally, the ratio of sulphur isotopes from bone collagen reflects the origin of foods consumed during the last 10–20 years of life of an adult individual. We used these three isotope systems to attempt to identify local and non‐local individuals at the site. We found that the isotope ratios of Sr, O and S of the humans were relatively homogeneous and generally correspond to the isotope signature of the local geology, climate and environment. We conclude that the sampled population is of local origin and does not show patterns of individual mobility, even though there is evidence for long‐distance trade and exchange of the metal artefacts at this site.","2012-08","2024-06-05 21:31:17","2024-07-11 15:43:14","2024-07-10 14:44:36","752-778","","4","54","","Archaeometry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solute chemistry of coastal river water contains significant information about environmental processes under the impact of both natural lithology and anthropogenic pressure. In this study, strontium (Sr) isotopes and water chemistry data of the Jiulongjiang (JLJ) river water were analyzed in detail to trace the contribution of bedrock weathering, and quantify Sr flux to the East China Sea (ECS). The dissolved Sr contents ranged 0.07–0.90 μmol L               −1               and greatly fluctuated where tributaries encountered, and               87               Sr/               86               Sr values relatively fluctuated between 0.7140 and 0.7514. Silicate weathering was identified to be the predominant contribution of riverine dissolved loads. Strontium flux to the ocean in dry season was estimated to be 689.2 tons per year, implying an essential influence on oceanic strontium evolution. In accordance with forward model, the silicate weathering rate and CO               2               consumption rate were 55.7 tons km               −2               per year and 16.9 × 10               5               mol km               −2               per year, respectively, slightly higher than world average. Considering anthropogenic impacts alongside the river, the integrated effect of lower runoff and longer retention time of river water in dry season may aggravate weathering processes. Although CO               2               sink by silicate weathering in JLJ seems less than the sink in world’s central reservoirs, it should still be taken into consideration for coastal carbon budget. These findings highlight the use of geochemical characteristics of strontium and its isotopes in identifying weathering process and output flux to the ocean, which provides basic data for sustainable coastal water resource management.","2022-04-05","2024-06-05 21:34:03","2024-07-11 15:44:51","2024-07-10 14:45:22","e13223","","","10","","","Geochemical characteristics of strontium isotopes in a coastal watershed","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\RY56ZESE\Zhang et al. - 2022 - Geochemical characteristics of strontium isotopes .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pour cela, nous présentons à deux saisons de nouvelles données isotopiques obtenues sur les fractions dissoutes et particulates des deux fleuves Parana et Uruguay qui forment le Rio de la Plata constituant en super¬ ficie le second bassin de drainage pour le continent sud-américain.             En néodyme, les échantillons d'eaux filtrées du fleuve Parana sont moins radiogéniques (sNd (0) compris entre -12,1 et -8,2) que ceux de l'Uruguay (valeur moyenne d'sNd (0) = -6,3 ± 0,3). Les matières en suspension montrent la même tendance isotopique que pour le dissous (valeurs moyennes respectives d'sNd (0) de -10,3 et -6,0 pour le Parana et l'Uruguay). Les rapports isotopiques 87Sr/S6Sr obtenus sur les deux fractions sont, à l'inverse du Nd, plus radiogéniques pour les échantillons du Parana (moyennes dissous : 0.7123 et particulate : 0,7247) que ceux de l'Uruguay (moyennes dissous : 0.7097 et particulate : 0,7115). Comparées au fleuve Parana, les signatures isotopiques relativement radiogéniques en Nd et non radiogéniques en Sr obtenues pour le fleuve Uruguay pourraient s'expliquer par la prédominance d'affleurements de basaltes tholéiitiques dans ce bassin.             Une ré-estimation des flux de Nd pour les fleuves du continent sud-américain se jetant dans les océans Atlantique Sud et tropical est proposée. Au total, le flux en Nd particulate entrant dans les zones estuariennes est de deux ordres de grandeur plus important que le flux en Nd dissous. En tenant compte des flux nets en Nd dissous et particulate des deux fleuves à l'amont de l'estuaire du Rio de la Plata, on obtient une valeur d' sNd(0) égale à -10.2. A la sortie de l'estuaire, les eaux du Rio de la Plata auraient une composition isotopique de -8.3 en prenant en compte des processus de soustraction dans l'estuaire.           ,              Our motivation is to better constrain the neodymium and strontium isotopic signatures of the closest continental riverine source (Parana and Uruguay rivers) to the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence zone in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. We thus present new isotopic data on the Nd and Sr of the dissolved and suspended loads of the Parana and Uruguay rivers for two water periods forming the Rio de la Plata whose drainage basin is the second largest one in South America.             The Parana dissolved material shows less radiogenic (sNd(0) ranging between -12.1 and -8.2) than the Uruguay one w ith a mean eNd (0) value of-6.3 ± 0.3. Suspended particulates display the same isotopic trend (mean eNd (0) value of -10.3 and -6.0 for the Parana and Uruguay rivers, respectively). Dissolved load 87Sr/S6Sr in the Parana (0.7123) is found to be more radiogenic than the Uruguay one (0.7097) ; the suspended load follows the same trend with 87Sr/S6Sr ratios of 0.7247 and 0.71 15 in the Parana and Uruguay rivers, respectively. The relatively radiogenic Nd and non radiogenic Sr of the Uruguay River as compared to the Parana River could be attributed to a predominance of tholeiitic basalts in the drainage basin.             A revisited estimation of the fluxes of Nd considering all South American rivers delivering into the western South and Tropical Atlantic Ocean yields a Nd particulate flux to estuarine water two orders of magnitude higher than the Nd dissolved flux. Considering the net dissolved and suspended fluxes of Nd reaching the Rio de la Plata, we have calculated a resulting eNd (0) equal to -10.2. The computation of sNd (0) of the Rio de la Plata outflow waters gives a value of -8.3, taking into account various removal processes within the estuary.","1996","2024-07-10 14:45:31","2024-07-10 14:45:31","2024-07-10 14:45:31","89-100","","1","49","","sgeol","","","","","","","","fr","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, we provide results for human samples from archaeological sites spanning the last 4000 years, a period during which a number of important socio‐demographic changes occurred. The results in human samples indicate overall isotopic fidelity to the values recorded in the local geology, suggesting a relatively restricted spatial scale of mobility during the late Holocene. This discussion is situated in a biogeographic research framework assessing topographic variation and landscape seasonality, and contributes toward understanding the movements of people, flow of material objects, and circulation of information in the Patagonian Andes.","2022-01","2024-06-05 21:28:58","2024-07-11 15:41:43","2024-07-10 14:46:27","227-241","","1","37","","Geoarchaeology","Scale of human mobility in northwestern Patagonia","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One could say that Scania represented in many ways a gateway for people, ideas and material culture connecting continental Europe with Sweden. Shedding light on the dynamics of human mobility in this region requires an in depth understanding of the local archaeological contexts across time. In this study, we present new archaeological human data from the Late Bronze Age Simris II site, located in an area of Scania showing a dynamic environment throughout the Late Bronze Age, thus likely involving various forms of mobility. Because the characterization of solid strontium isotope baselines is vital for delineating human mobility in prehistory using the strontium isotope methodology, we introduce the first environmentally based multi-proxy (surface water-, plant- and soil leachates) strontium isotope baselines for sub-regions of Scania. Our results show, that the highly complex and spatially scattered lithologies characterising Scania does not allow for a spatially meaningful, geology-based grouping of multi-proxy data that could be beneficial for provenance studies. Instead, we propose sub-regional baselines for areas that don’t necessarily fully correspond and reflect the immediate distribution of bedrock lithologies. Rather than working with a Scania-wide multi-proxy baseline, which we define as               87               Sr/               86               Sr = 0.7133 ± 0.0059 (n = 102, 2σ), we propose sub-regional, multi-proxy baselines as follows: Area 1, farthest to the north, by               87               Sr/               86               Sr = 0.7184 ± 0.0061 (n = 16, 2σ); Area 2, comprising the mid and western part of Scania, with               87               Sr/               86               Sr = 0.7140 ± 0.0043 (n = 48, 2σ); Area 3–4, roughly corresponding to a NW-SE trending zone dominated by horst-graben tectonics across Scania, plus the carbonate dominated south western part of Scania with               87               Sr/               86               Sr = 0.7110 ± 0.0030 (n = 39, 2σ). Our results also reflect that the complexity of the geology of Scania requires systematic, high density, statistically sound sampling of multiple proxies to adequately constrain the baseline ranges, particularly of those areas dominated by Precambrian lithologies. The averaging effect of biosphere Sr in surface water might be beneficial for the characterization of baselines in such terranes. Our sub-regional, area-specific baselines allow for a first comparison of different baseline construction strategies (single-proxy versus multi-proxy; Scania-wide versus sub-regional). From the Late Bronze Age Simris II site, we identified six individuals that could be analysed for Sr isotopes, to allow for an interpretation of their provenance using the newly established, environmental strontium isotope baselines. All but one signature agrees with the local baselines, including the               87               Sr/               86               Sr value we measured for a young individual buried in a house urn, typically interpreted as evidence for long distance contacts. The results are somewhat unexpected and provides new aspects into the complexity of Scandinavian Bronze Age societies.","2021-04-21","2024-07-10 14:46:50","2024-07-10 14:46:50","2024-07-10 14:46:50","e0250279","","4","16","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\9J3UBH55\Ladegaard-Pedersen et al. - 2021 - Testing Late Bronze Age mobility in southern Swede.pdf","","","","Bondioli, Luca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The               δ               D and               δ               18               O values of the Yellow River water vary in large ranges from −32‰ to −91‰ and from −3.1‰ to −12.5‰, respectively. The characters of H and O isotope variations indicate that the major sources of the Yellow River water are meteoric water and snow melting water, and water cycle in the Yellow River basin is affected strongly by evaporation process and human activity. The average SPM content (9.635 g/L) of the Yellow River is the highest among the world large rivers. Compared with the Yangtze River, the Yellow River SPM has much lower clay content and significantly higher contents of clastic silicates and carbonates. In comparison to the upper crust rocks, the Yellow River SPM contains less SiO               2               , CaO, K               2               O and Na               2               O, but more TFe               2               O               3               , Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd. The abnormal high Cd contents found in some sample may be related to local industrial activity. The REE contents and distribution pattern of the Yellow River SPM are very close to the average value of the global shale. The average               δ               30               Si               SPM               in the Yellow River (–0.11‰) is slightly higher than the average value (–0.22‰) of the Yangtze River SPM. The major factors controlling the               δ               30               Si               spm               of the Yellow River are the soil supply, the isotopic composition of the soil and the climate conditions. The TDS in the Yellow River are the highest among those of world large rivers. Fair correlations are observed among CI               −               , Na               +               , K               +               , and Mg               2+               contents of the Yellow River water, indicating the effect of evaporation. The Ca               2+               and Sr               2+               concentrations show good correlation to the SO               4               2–               concentration rather than HCO               3               −               concentration, reflecting its origin from evaporates. The NO               3               −               contents are affected by farmland fertilization. The Cu, Zn and Cd contents in dissolved load of the Yellow River water are all higher than those of average world large rivers, reflecting the effect of human activity. The dissolved load in the Yellow River water generally shows a REE distribution pattern parallel to those for the Yangtze River and the Xijiang River. The               δ               30               Si values of the dissolved silicon vary in a range from 0.4‰ to 2.9‰, averaging 1.34‰. The major processes controlling the D               Si               and               δ               30               Si               diss               of the Yellow River water are the weathering process of silicate rocks, growth of phytolith in plants, evaporation, dissolution of phytolith in soil, growth of fresh water diatom, adsorption and desorption of aqueous monosilicic acid on iron oxide and human activities.

Information from these analyses offers, in a direct way, insights into the biological distance, and consequently the gene flow and mobility patterns, among human populations in eastern Crete. The results are synthesised with the evidence of funerary practices in order to explore the nature of interaction among communities in eastern Crete. The biodistance analysis supports a strong genetic affinity between the populations represented at the two Kephala Petras skeletal assemblages, while the results of the available strontium isotope analysis favour their local origin; thus the combined results suggest the lack of significant population influx. The biological distance of the two chronologically contemporary populations at Livari-Skiadi, also manifesting completely different patterns of mortuary disposal, is of particular interest since it contrasts with the Petras situation and raises issues of intra-community distinctions, cultural and biological.           ,                             Ανθρώπινη κινητικότητα και βιολογικές συγγένειες στο νότιο Αιγαίο: μια πρώτη προσέγγιση στὴν ανατολική Κρήτη στὴν πρώιμη εποχή του Χαλκού                                         Το άρθρο παρουσιάζει τα αποτελέσματα ενός πιλοτικού ερευνητικού προγράμματος και συνδυάζει για πρώτη φορά τις βιολογικές αποστάσεις πληθυσμιακών ομάδων με τις αναλύσεις σταθερών ισοτόπων του στροντίου σε ανθρώπινα σκελετικά κατάλοιπα που προέρχονται από την Κρήτη στην Πρώιμη εποχή του Χαλκού (τρίτη χιλιετία π.Χ.).

The present study measured strontium (Sr) isotopes with hydro-geochemistry data of 56 water samples in detail in the MRB in northeast Thailand. The dissolved Sr contents and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios were reported to be 8.7–344.6 μg/L (average 126.9 μg/L) and 0.7085–0.7281 (average 0.7156), respectively. The concentrations of dissolved Sr in the mainstream slightly decreased from upstream to downstream, while the variation trend of 87Sr/86Sr was on the contrary. Correlation analysis showed that Na+ strongly correlated with Cl− (0.995, p < 0.01), while Ca2+ exhibited weak relationships with SO42− (0.356, p < 0.01). Samples of the MRB exhibited lower Mg2+/Na+, Ca2+/Na+, HCO3−/Na+ and 1000Sr/Na ratios, and gathered around the end-member of evaporite dissolution, with slight shift to silicate weathering end-member, demonstrating the dominant contribution of evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering on dissolved loads. Comparing with data of major world rivers from previous research, our results remained consistency with rivers draining through similar geological conditions. The dissolved Sr flux to the adjacent Mekong River was estimated to be 20.7 tons/year. In accordance with the forward model, silicate weathering rate and CO2 consumption rate during dry season were calculated to be 0.73 tons/km2/year and 1.94 × 104 mol/km2/year, and may get underestimated due to intense water consumption by extensive agricultural activities. The superimposed effect of anthropogenic impacts on the water environment could enhance chemical weathering, and thus should be taken into account in regional ion cycles and carbon budgets. These findings highlight the coupling analysis of Sr isotopes and hydro-geochemistry in Earth surface processes and provide basic investigation for sustainable regional water treatment mechanisms in the pan basin of the Mekong River.","2021-11-08","2024-06-05 21:33:59","2024-07-11 15:44:49","2024-07-10 14:48:05","3137","","21","13","","Water","A Strontium and Hydro-Geochemical Perspective on Human Impacted Tributary of the Mekong River Basin","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\7NTSNFTQ\Zhang et al. - 2021 - A Strontium and Hydro-Geochemical Perspective on H.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Calibrated radiocarbon ages for 10 bones from extinct primates span the last three millennia. The largely undisturbed taphonomy of bone deposits supports the interpretation that many specimens fell in from a rock ledge above the entrance.

Pottery sherds and bones of extinct and extant vertebrates with cut and chop marks indicate human activity in previous centuries.

Genetic and isotopic analysis of horses in Balt cemeteries [1st to 13th centuries CE (Common Era)] dismantle prevailing narratives that locally procured stallions were exclusively selected. Strontium isotope analysis provides direct evidence for long-distance (~300 to 1500 kilometers) maritime transport of Fennoscandian horses to the eastern Baltic in the Late Viking Age (11th to 13th centuries CE). Genetic analysis proves that horses of both sexes were sacrificed with 34% identified as mares. Results transform the understanding of selection criteria, disprove sex-based selection, and elevate prestige value as a more crucial factor.

Strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) are useful to trace processes in the Earth sciences as well as in forensic, archaeological, palaeontological, and ecological sciences. As very few large-scale Sr isoscapes exist in Australia, we have identified an opportunity to determine 87Sr/86Sr ratios on archived fluvial sediment samples from the low-density National Geochemical Survey of Australia. The present study targeted the northern parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland, north of 21.5∘ S. The samples were taken mostly from a depth of ∼60–80 cm in floodplain deposits at or near the outlet of large catchments (drainage basins). A coarse (<2 mm) grain-size fraction was air-dried, sieved, milled, and digested (hydrofluoric acid + nitric acid followed by aqua regia) to release total Sr. The Sr was then separated by chromatography, and the 87Sr/86Sr ratio was determined by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results demonstrate a wide range of Sr isotopic values (0.7048 to 1.0330) over the survey area, reflecting a large diversity of source rock lithologies, geological processes, and bedrock ages. The spatial distribution of 87Sr/86Sr shows coherent (multi-point anomalies and smooth gradients), large-scale (>100 km) patterns that appear to be broadly consistent with surface geology, regolith/soil type, and/or nearby outcropping bedrock. For instance, the extensive black clay soils of the Barkly Tableland define a >500 km long northwest–southeast-trending unradiogenic anomaly (87Sr/86Sr <0.7182). Where sedimentary carbonate or mafic/ultramafic igneous rocks dominate, low to moderate 87Sr/86Sr values are generally recorded (medians of 0.7387 and 0.7422, respectively). Conversely, In proximity to the outcropping Proterozoic metamorphic basement of the Tennant, McArthur, Murphy, and Mount Isa geological regions, radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr values (>0.7655) are observed. A potential correlation between mineralization and elevated 87Sr/86Sr values in these regions needs to be investigated in greater detail. Our results to date indicate that incorporating soil/regolith Sr isotopes in regional, exploratory geoscience investigations can help identify basement rock types under (shallow) cover, constrain surface processes (e.g. weathering and dispersion), and, potentially, recognize components of mineral systems. Furthermore, the resulting Sr isoscape and future models derived therefrom can also be utilized in forensic, archaeological, palaeontological, and ecological studies that aim to investigate, for example, past and modern animal (including humans) dietary habits and migrations. The new spatial Sr isotope dataset for the northern Australia region is publicly available (de Caritat et al., 2022a; https://doi.org/10.26186/147473).","2023-04-14","2024-07-10 14:48:50","2024-07-10 14:48:50","2024-07-10 14:48:50","1655-1673","","4","15","","Earth Syst.

Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr ∕ 86Sr) of biogenic material such as bones and teeth reflect the local sources of strontium ingested as food and drink during their formation. This has led to the use of strontium isotope ratios as a geochemical tracer in a wide range of fields including archaeology, ecology, food studies and forensic sciences. In order to utilise strontium as a geochemical tracer, baseline data of bioavailable 87Sr ∕ 86Sr in the region of interest are required, and a growing number of studies have developed reference maps for this purpose in various geographic regions, and over varying scales. This study presents a new data set of bioavailable strontium isotope ratios from rock and soil samples across Israel, as well as from sediment layers from seven key archaeological sites.

Punt was a pivotal early node in the rise of this enterprise, serving as an important emporium for luxury goods, including sacred baboons (               Papio hamadryas               ), but its location is disputed. Here, we use geospatial variation in the oxygen and strontium isotope ratios of 155 baboons from 77 locations to estimate the geoprovenance of mummified baboons recovered from ancient Egyptian temples and tombs. Five Ptolemaic specimens of               P. anubis               (404–40 BC) showed evidence of long-term residency in Egypt prior to mummification, consistent with a captive breeding program. Two New Kingdom specimens of               P. hamadryas               were sourced to a region that encompasses much of present-day Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti, and portions of Somalia and Yemen. This result is a testament to the tremendous reach of Egyptian seafaring during the 2nd millennium BC. It also corroborates the balance of scholarly conjecture on the location of Punt.                        ,              Strontium is a chemical element that can act as a geographic fingerprint: its composition differs between locations, and as it enters the food chain, it can help to retrace the life history of extant or past animals. In particular, strontium in teeth – which stop to develop early – can reveal where an individual was born; strontium in bone and hair, on the other hand, can show where it lived just before death. Together, these analyses may hold the key to archaeological mysteries, such as the location of a long-lost kingdom revered by ancient Egyptians.             For hundreds of years, the Land of Punt was one of Egypt’s strongest trading partners, and a place from which to import premium incense and prized monkeys. Travellers could reach Punt by venturing south and east of Egypt, suggesting that the kingdom occupied the southern Red Sea region. Yet its exact location is still highly debated.             To investigate, Dominy et al. examined the mummies of baboons present in ancient Egyptian tombs, and compared the strontium compositions of the bones, hair and teeth of these remains with the ones found in baboons living in various regions across Africa. This shed a light on the origins of the ancient baboons: while some were probably raised in captivity in Egypt, others were born in modern Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Yemen – areas already highlighted as potential locations for the Land of Punt.             The work by Dominy et al. helps to better understand the ancient trade routes that shaped geopolitical fortunes for millennia. It also highlights the need for further archaeological research in Eritrea and Somalia, two areas which are currently understudied.","2020-12-15","2024-06-05 21:28:36","2024-07-11 15:41:31","2024-07-10 14:49:31","e60860","","","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\B3BRWKG8\Dominy et al. - 2020 - Mummified baboons reveal the far reach of early Eg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attention was focused on weathering and exchange processes, with special emphasis on the origin of the current soil exchangeable fraction and the influence of the atmospheric deposition and biological cycling on the calcium exchangeable pool (Sr acts as a proxy for Ca).

It dates to the late ninth century and is associated with the over-wintering of the Viking Great Army at nearby Repton in AD 873–4. Only the cremated remains of three humans and of a few animals are still available for research. Using strontium content and isotope ratios of these three people and three animals–a horse, a dog and a possible pig–this paper investigates the individuals’ residential origins. The results demonstrate that strontium isotope ratios of one of the adults and the non-adult are compatible with a local origin, while the other adult and all three animals are not. In conjunction with the archaeological context, the strontium isotope ratios indicate that these individuals most likely originated from the area of the Baltic Shield–and that they died soon after arrival in Britain. This discovery constitutes the first solid scientific evidence that Scandinavians crossed the North Sea with horses, dogs and other animals as early as the ninth century AD.","2023-02-01","2024-06-05 21:30:36","2024-07-11 15:42:54","2024-07-10 14:50:35","e0280589","","2","18","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\27PKK8WF\Löffelmann et al. - 2023 - Sr analyses from only known Scandinavian cremation.pdf","","","","Bondioli, Luca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work we analysed the               87               Sr/               86               Sr, δ               18               O and δ               13               C isotope composition of 65 moose bone and antler samples from Sweden from wild-shot individuals dated between 1800 and 1994 to study moose mobility and feeding behaviour for (paleo)ecological applications. Sr data were compared with isoscapes of the Scandinavian region, built               ad-hoc               during this study, to understand how moose utilise the landscape in Northern Europe. The               87               Sr/               86               Sr isoscape was developed using a machine-learning approach with external geo-environmental predictors and literature data. Similarly, a δ               18               O isoscape, obtained from average annual precipitation δ               18               O values, was employed to highlight differences in the isotope composition of the local environment vs. bone/antler. Overall, 82% of the moose samples were compatible with the likely local isotope composition (n = 53), suggesting that they were shot not far from their year-round dwelling area. ‘Local’ samples were used to calibrate the two isoscapes, to improve the prediction of provenance for the presumably ‘non-local’ individuals. For the latter (n = 12, of which two are antlers and ten are bones), the probability of geographic origin was estimated using a Bayesian approach by combining the two isoscapes. Interestingly, two of these samples (one antler and one bone) seem to come from areas more than 250 km away from the place where the animals were hunted, indicating a possible remarkable intra-annual mobility. Finally, the δ               13               C data were compared with the forest cover of Sweden and ultimately used to understand the dietary preference of moose. We interpreted a difference in δ               13               C values of antlers (               13               C-enriched) and bones (               13               C-depleted) as a joint effect of seasonal variations in moose diet and, possibly, physiological stresses during winter-time, i.e., increased consumption of endogenous               13               C-depleted lipids.","2024-04-10","2024-07-10 14:51:25","2024-07-10 14:51:25","2024-07-10 14:51:25","e0300867","","4","19","","PLoS ONE","Spatial ecology of moose in Sweden","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\2G43VP9C\Armaroli et al. - 2024 - Spatial ecology of moose in Sweden Combined Sr-O-.pdf","","","","Nikita, Efthymia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oxygen isotope values may be able to distinguish animals that lived during the Last Glacial Maximum (               LGM               ) from those that lived more recently. Three mammoths and one mastodon yielded                                                   δ                   18                   O                                               values that are similar to modern regional precipitation and surface water, but too high for estimated drinking water during the               LGM               . We propose that these individuals lived during a relatively warm period following the               LGM               .

This paper presents a map of strontium isotope variations across Britain for use in archaeological and other studies, and is produced by direct measurement of strontium isotope compositions of biosphere components, predominantly plants.

For the Phoenician and Punic periods (from the 9               th               to the 3               rd               centuries BCE), the ancient site of Nora—in southern Sardinia—represents an emblematic case in the study of migratory phenomena that occurred on the Island from the Iron Age until the Roman conquest. Despite the importance of exploring (and characterising) such movements from a wider bio-cultural perspective, the application of bio-geochemical tools for geographical provenance to the ancient skeletal populations of Sardinia is yet scarce. The present work is the first step towards filling this gap with the development of the first isoscape of southern Sardinia using new bioavailable Sr isotope data and a machine-learning approach. From a geolithological point of view, Sardinia is rather heterogeneous and requires detailed studies to correctly assess the distribution of the isotopic signature of bioavailable Sr. The random forest model employed here to construct the Sr isoscape uses several external environmental and geological variables. The most important predictors are related to age and bedrock type, with additional input from local soil properties. A 10-fold cross-validation gives a mean square error of 0.0008 and an R-squared of 0.81, so the model correctly predicts the               87               Sr/               86               Sr ratio of unknown areas. By using a Bayesian provenance assignment workflow, we tested the isoscape here produced to determine the geographic origin and the mobility of archaeological and modern fauna collected from the Phoenician-Punic site of Nora and the surrounding Pula Plain. Our results indicate that archaeological sheep and goats (               87               Sr/               86               Sr < 0.7090) are compatible with areas close to Nora and Pula Plain, in agreement with archaeological evidence of pastoralism in those areas. Modern wild and domesticated fauna (               87               Sr/               86               Sr > 0.7090) show compatibility with several natural and anthropogenic locations in southern Sardinia, as expected based on modern species distribution data. Finally, we discuss the large Sr isotopic variability of the Nora baseline, where human mobility studies of human cremated and inhumed individuals are currently underway.","2023-07-19","2024-06-05 21:29:06","2024-07-11 15:41:49","2024-07-10 14:51:58","e0287787","","7","18","","PLoS ONE","Machine learning-based Sr isoscape of southern Sardinia","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\KNCWZFA8\Gigante et al. - 2023 - Machine learning-based Sr isoscape of southern Sar.pdf","","","","Gimatzidis, Stefanos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we use oxygen and strontium isotope analyses to establish whether animal protein followed a similar pattern. We contextualized our isotopic analyses of the archaeofaunas from recent excavations at Pueblo Bonito with data on modern faunas across an area of approximately 100,000 km               2               around the site. Our results show that most archaeological deer, rabbits, and prairie dogs were obtained from >40 km away from Pueblo Bonito with the latter two likely being garden hunted. The Chuska Mountains west of Chaco Canyon and more distant San Juan Mountains to the north were the main source areas. These results closely align with previous results on architectural wood, corn, and other key resources. The importation of small game animals suggests that the local supplies could not meet the needs of the community. Long‐distance meat procurement may have been embedded within a more complex network of ritual‐goods exchange or tribute that helped to offset the transport costs. Resource depletion may have contributed to the eventual abandonment of the region during the Medieval Warm Period.","2016-09","2024-07-10 14:52:03","2024-07-10 14:52:03","2024-07-10 14:52:03","335-354","","5","31","","Geoarchaeology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study investigates the validity of this assessment using modern anthropological methods to assess cranial variation in two groups: The Railway and Trentholme Drive. Strontium and oxygen isotope evidence derived from the dentition of 43 of these individuals was combined with the craniometric data to provide information on possible levels of migration and the range of homelands that may be represented. The results of the craniometric analysis indicated that the majority of the York population had European origins, but that 11% of the Trentholme Drive and 12% of The Railway study samples were likely of African decent. Oxygen analysis identified four incomers, three from areas warmer than the UK and one from a cooler or more continental climate. Although based on a relatively small sample of the overall population at York, this multidisciplinary approach made it possible to identify incomers, both men and women, from across the Empire. Evidence for possible second generation migrants was also suggested. The results confirm the presence of a heterogeneous population resident in York and highlight the diversity, rather than the uniformity, of the population in Roman Britain.

We studied six animal teeth of horse (               Equus hydruntinus               ) and red deer (               Cervus elaphus               ) from four different archaeological sites: the Grotta di Vado all'Arancio, Grotta di Settecannelle, Grotta Polesini and Grotta di Pozzo, in central Italy to test whether the migratory patterns and seasonal variations recorded in their teeth were consistent with expectations of the transhumance model for this region during the late Upper Palaeolithic. Sequential sub‐samples of enamel were analysed from each tooth for oxygen, carbon and strontium isotope ratios to reconstruct mobility and yearly seasonal variations. The results show little evidence that these animals were moving over different geological terrains throughout the year, although small variations in Sr isotope ratios and concentrations were detected that corresponded to probable seasonal variations as shown by variability in oxygen isotope sequences. The results do, however, demonstrate that               Cervus elaphus               and               Equus hydruntinus               had different ranging behaviours, with the former moving over wider areas than the latter.

CE), including cotton seeds and fabrics, have been preserved in a burned-down fortified building. To better understand the initial trade and/or production of cotton in this region, strontium isotopes of leached, charred cotton remains are used as a powerful tracer and the results indicate that the earliest cotton finds did not originate from the Oman Peninsula, but were more likely sourced from further afield, with the north-western coast of India being an isotopically compatible provenance. Identifying the presence of such imported cotton textiles and seeds in southeastern Arabia is significant as it is representative of the early diffusion of the crop in the region, later to be grown extensively in local oases.","2021-01-11","2024-07-10 14:52:59","2024-07-10 14:52:59","2024-07-10 14:52:59","303","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\3M597UYX\Ryan et al. - 2021 - Strontium isotope evidence for a trade network bet.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the Afar plume emplacement (∼30 Ma), volcanism took place in Yemen and progressively propagated northward due to Red Sea rifting-related lithospheric thinning (initiated ∼27–25 Ma). Few lava fields were emplaced during the Mesozoic, with the oldest 200 Ma volcanic activity recorded in northern Israel. We report results from volcanic pipes in the Marthoum area, east of Harrat Uwayrid, where over a hundred pipes occupy a stratigraphic level in the early Ordovician Saq sandstones. Most of them are circular or elliptical features marked by craters aligned along NW-SE fractures in the sandstone resulting from phreatomagmatic explosions that occurred when rising magma columns came in contact with the water table in the porous sandstone host. These lavas have Sr-Pb-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions far from the Cenozoic Arabian alkaline volcanism field, being considerably more enriched in Nd-Hf and Pb isotopes than any other Arabian Plate lava ever reported. New K-Ar dating constrains their age from Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene, thus anticipating the Afar plume emplacement and the Red Sea rift. Basalt geochemistry indicates that these volcanic eruptions formed from low-degree partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle source triggered by local variations in the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary. This mantle source has a composition similar to the HIMU-like enriched isotopic component reported in the East African Rift and considered to represent the lowermost lithospheric mantle of the Nubian Shield. The generated melt, mixed in different proportions with melt derived from a depleted asthenosphere, produces the HIMU-like character throughout the Cenozoic Arabian alkaline volcanism. Although apparently hidden, this enriched lithospheric component is therefore ubiquitous and widespread in the cratonic roots of the African and Arabian subcontinental mantle.","2021-08-02","2024-06-05 21:31:43","2024-07-11 15:43:35","2024-07-10 14:53:03","699460","","","9","","Front.

In this study, isotope analysis of animal remains from Ceibal, Guatemala, provides the earliest direct evidence of live animal trade and possible captive animal rearing in the Maya region. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes show that domesticated and possibly even wild animals were raised in or around Ceibal and were deposited in the ceremonial core. Strontium isotope analysis reveals the Maya brought dogs to Ceibal from the distant Guatemalan highlands. The possible ceremonial contexts of these captive-reared and imported taxa suggests animal management played an important role in the symbolic development of political power.           ,              This study uses a multiisotope (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium) approach to examine early animal management in the Maya region. An analysis of faunal specimens across almost 2,000 years (1000 BC to AD 950) at the site of Ceibal, Guatemala, reveals the earliest evidence for live-traded dogs and possible captive-reared taxa in the Americas. These animals may have been procured for ceremonial functions based on their location in the monumental site core, suggesting that animal management and trade began in the Maya area to promote special events, activities that were critical in the development of state society. Isotopic evidence for animal captivity at Ceibal reveals that animal management played a greater role in Maya communities than previously believed.","2018-04-03","2024-07-10 14:53:13","2024-07-10 14:53:13","2024-07-10 14:53:13","3605-3610","","14","115","","Proc.

The unusual nature of this settlement has been noted for many years and the origin of the inhabitants has been the subject of considerable debate. The similarities between the materials at Aztalan and other Mississippian period sites to the south in Illinois have long been noted. The largest center of the Mississippian culture at Cahokia near East St. Louis, Illinois, has often been cited as the likely home of the founders of Aztalan. Using strontium isotopes in human teeth and bone we examine the question of migration and the possibility of nonlocal individuals among the skeletal remains from Aztalan. Our results suggest that there were a number of foreign individuals among the locals. The isotopic signal for some of the foreigners matches values from Cahokia, but does not prove that this was their place of origin.           ,              Résumé             El sitio arqueológico de Aztalan al sureste del estado de Wisconsin es un complejo grande de montículos y otras estructuras palizadas ubicadas en las orillas del Río Crawfish, en el condado Jefferson.

In the present study, Golden Delicious apples from PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) cultivation districts were characterized according to their Sr isotope composition and compared with apples from other Northern Italian districts.                                         RESULTS                                Apples collected in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) confirmed the low annual variability of the                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr ratio. The isotope ratio of apples was highly correlated with that of the soil extracts of the respective orchards. Statistical differences were highlighted between cultivation districts. However, because similar geological features characterized some areas, their ratios overlapped and a complete separation of the districts was not possible.

Strontium isotope analysis of tooth enamel and bone are a useful geochemical tracer to investigate the origin and residential mobility of ancient people.

Results obtained do not support our hypothesis of mobility for a number of individuals considered as outsiders in a previous study. On the other hand, the difference recorded between teeth and bone suggests mobility of other individuals between childhood and the last years of adult life.

Les rapports isotopiques du strontium dans l'émail dentaire et l'os sont des traceurs pertinents pour connaitre les origines géographiques et la mobilité résidentielle potentielle des populations humaines. Les analyses ont été effectuées sur le matériel provenant de 5 sites localisés dans deux espaces géographiques: le Languedoc et la Garonne. Les résultats ne confortent pas l'hypothèse d'une mobilité pour certains individus du Languedoc. En revanche, les différences enregistrées entre l'émail et l'os suggèrent des déplacements entre l'enfance et l'âge adulte pour d'autres sujets.                        ,                             Dieser Beitrag präsentiert die ersten Ergebnisse von               87               Sr/               86               Sr-Analysen, die anhand von Skelettmaterial neolithischer Individuen aus Südfrankreich gewonnen wurden.

While this transformation was initially attributed to invasion or conquest, more recent, nuanced interpretations of archaeological and biological data now emphasize the decline of palatial economies, a shift away from centralized political authority, and internal social restructuring amidst rapid climate change in lieu of “collapse.” Correspondingly, the hypothesis that Early Iron Age populations in Palestine represent the same ethnic group whose culture nevertheless underwent considerable change by actively adapting to internal and external forces was tested using biogeochemical data from individuals interred within an Early Iron Age tomb at the site of Tell Dothan.

Here we investigate the possibility that political refugees occupied Khirbet edh‐Dharih after Roman takeover, using strontium isotope analysis of archaeological human dental enamel. We additionally discuss regional patterning of 87Sr/86Sr in western Jordan based on archaeological faunal dental enamel samples to understand strontium isotope spatial heterogeneity and to facilitate interpretation of the Dharih results. Strontium isotope analysis of small mammal dentition varied as expected based on bedrock geology, but small faunal sample sizes did not accurately reflect the broad range of biologically available strontium at Dharih. Only one person at Khirbet edh‐Dharh appears to be non‐local based on isotopic data. The status of the remaining individuals is unclear, as they could have originated from Dharih or the Nabataean capital city of Petra. Incorporating modern fauna and soil samples to establish the local value may assist in characterizing the local strontium in a geologically complex area such as Dharih. Futhermore, future analysis of elemental strontium to assess dietary composition and diagenetic contamination would facilitate interpretation of the strontium sources in the Dharih individuals. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2008-07","2024-07-10 14:55:12","2024-07-10 14:55:12","2024-07-10 14:55:12","528-549","","4","23","","Geoarchaeology","Mobility and exile at 2nd century A.D. khirbet edh‐dharih","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monasteries saw record growth at this time as pilgrims chose to stay in the region and take up religious life. A major influx of people to the region, with a corresponding growth in monastic vocations that led travelers to stay in the area, is not in question; however, the distant origins of pilgrims reflected in surviving texts may be an artifact of preservation, biased towards an elite minority. The Byzantine monastery of St. Stephen's provides an opportunity to study this question from a bioarchaeological perspective, given the excellent preservation of the human skeletal assemblage, a wealth of written works about the community as well as daily life in Byzantine Palestine, and a rich archaeological record for the site and region. Materials and Methods: An analysis of radiogenic strontium isotope values from the third molars of 22 individuals recovered from the St. Stephen's crypt complex was conducted to test whether those interred at the monastery were of local origin. Results: Of those examined (                                  = 0.7084 ± 0.0007, 1                 σ                 ), 8 out of 22 (36%) exhibited                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr ratios that fell outside of local ranges. Discussion: These results confirmed the sizeable presence of nonlocals at St. Stephen's Monastery. While most of these migrants likely traveled to Jerusalem from different areas of the Levant as pilgrims, others may have hailed from further afield, including Europe.

The interments of multiple individuals in Burial 7 of Structure B1, the central structure of an Eastern Triadic Assemblage or “E-group” style architectural complex, were in a manner not consistent with the greater Belize River Valley, the only multiple individual human burial yet encountered at Cahal Pech. The sequential interments contained a suggestive quantity of high-quality artifacts, further setting them apart from their contemporaries. Among these artifacts were a set of bone rings and a hairpin inscribed with hieroglyphs, some of the few inscriptions ever found at Cahal Pech. We analyzed regional mortuary patterns, radiogenic strontium values, and radiocarbon data to test hypotheses about who these individuals were in life, why they were treated differently in death, and to reconstruct the sequence of events of this complex mortuary deposit. We contend that the mortuary practices in Burial 7 indicate an attempt by the Cahal Pech elite to identify with cities or regions outside the Belize River Valley area.           ,              En este estudio empleamos múltiples líneas de evidencia para elucidar el uso de rituales mortuorios por parte de la elite gobernante en el antiguo sitio Maya de Cahal Pech, Belice, durante los períodos Clásico temprano y Clásico tardío temprano (250–630 dC). Los individuos hallados en el Entierro 7 de la Estructura B1, el edificio central de un complejo tríadico o “Grupo E”, fueron sepultados de una forma que no es congruente con las costumbres funerarias del valle del Río Belice. Aún más, se trata del único entierro múltiple registrado en Cahal Pech hasta el día de hoy. Estos entierros se hicieron de manera consecutiva y presentan una cantidad de artefactos de alta calidad, distanciándolos de las costumbres mortuorias contemporáneas. Entre estos artefactos se halló un juego de anillos de hueso y un broche para cabello inscrito con glifos, el cual representa una de las pocas inscripciones encontradas en Cahal Pech. En este trabajo analizamos patrones mortuorios regionales, valores de estroncio radiogénicos y datos de radiocarbono para poner a prueba nuestra hipótesis acerca de quiénes fueron estos individuos en vida, por qué fueron tratados de manera diferente en la muerte y cuál fue la secuencia de eventos que contribuyeron a este complejo depósito mortuorio. Sugerimos que las prácticas mortuorias del Entierro 7 parecen indicar un intento por parte de la elite de Cahal Pech de identificarse con ciudades o regiones fuera del área del Valle del Río Belice.","2018-12","2024-07-10 14:55:33","2024-07-10 14:55:33","2024-07-10 14:55:33","641-659","","4","29","","Latin Am. antiq.","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Strontium isotope analysis of one preferred San exchange item, ostrich eggshell beads, from highland Lesotho shows that since the late Middle Stone Age ∼33 ka, such networks connected ecologically complementary regions over minimal distances of several hundred kilometers. Rapidly changing environmental conditions during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (∼59 to 25 ka) likely placed a premium on developing effective means of mitigating subsistence and demographic risks, with ostrich eggshell beads providing a uniform medium of personal decoration and exchange highly suitable for binding together extended open social networks.           ,                             Hunter-gatherer exchange networks dampen subsistence and reproductive risks by building relationships of mutual support outside local groups that are underwritten by symbolic gift exchange.

However, its antiquity, drivers, and development remain unclear, as they do for long-distance exchanges among African foragers more broadly. Here we show through strontium isotope analyses of ostrich eggshell beads from highland Lesotho, and associated strontium isoscape development, that such practices stretch back into the late Middle Stone Age. We argue that these exchange items originated beyond the macroband from groups occupying the more water-stressed subcontinental interior.

Aotearoa New Zealand is an island nation with many endemic species, a strong local agricultural industry, and a need to protect these from pest threats, as well as the economy from fraudulent commodities. Mitigation of such threats is much more effective if their origins and pathways for entry are understood. We propose that this may be addressed in Aotearoa using strontium isotope analysis of both pests and products. Bioavailable radiogenic isotopes of strontium are ubiquitous markers of provenance that are increasingly used to trace the origin of animals and plants as well as products, but currently a baseline map across Aotearoa is lacking, preventing use of this technique. Here, we have improved an existing methodology to develop a regional bioavailable strontium isoscape using the best available geospatial datasets for Aotearoa. The isoscape explains 53% of the variation (R               2               = 0.53 and RMSE = 0.00098) across the region, for which the primary drivers are the underlying geology, soil pH, and aerosol deposition (dust and sea salt). We tested the potential of this model to determine the origin of cow milk produced across Aotearoa. Predictions for cow milk (n = 33) highlighted all potential origin locations that share similar               87               Sr/               86               Sr values, with the closest predictions averaging 7.05 km away from their true place of origin. These results demonstrate that this bioavailable strontium isoscape is effective for tracing locally produced agricultural products in Aotearoa. Accordingly, it could be used to certify the origin of Aotearoa’s products, while also helping to determine if new pest detections were of locally breeding populations or not, or to raise awareness of imported illegal agricultural products.","2022-03-16","2024-06-10 18:02:30","2024-07-11 15:42:42","2024-07-10 14:55:53","e0264458","","3","17","","PLoS ONE","A bioavailable strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isoscape for Aotearoa New Zealand","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\5N24GYSK\Kramer et al. - 2022 - A bioavailable strontium (87Sr86Sr) isoscape for .pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\MWR4XFQH\Kramer et al. - 2022 - A bioavailable strontium (87Sr86Sr) isoscape for .pdf","","","","Cooper, Lee W.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypotheses regarding the nature of Tiwanaku influence using strontium isotope, trace element concentration, and oxygen isotope data from archaeological human tooth enamel and bone from Tiwanaku‐ and Chiribaya‐affiliated sites in the south central Andes. Strontium isotope analysis of 25 individuals buried at the Tiwanaku‐affiliated Moquegua Valley site of Chen Chen demonstrates that it was likely a Tiwanaku colony. In contrast, no immigrants from the Lake Titicaca Basin were present in 27 individuals analyzed from the San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries of Coyo Oriental, Coyo‐3, and Solcor‐3; it is likely that these sites represent economic and religious alliances, but not colonies. However, strontium isotope analysis alone cannot distinguish movement between the Tiwanaku‐ and Chiribaya‐affiliated sites in the Moquegua and Ilo Valleys of southern Peru. Analyzing oxygen isotope and trace element concentration data and comparing it with strontium isotope data from the same individuals provides a more detailed picture of residential mobility in the Tiwanaku and Chiribaya polities. In addition to monitoring diagenetic contamination, trace element concentration data identified movement during adulthood for certain individuals. However, these data could not distinguish movement between the Moquegua and Ilo Valleys. While oxygen isotope data could clearly distinguish the high‐altitude sites from others, more data is needed to characterize the local oxygen isotope ratios of these regions. These data demonstrate the potential for archaeological reconstruction of residential mobility through multiple lines of evidence.

Strontium isotope data from archaeological human remains from Tiwanaku-affiliated sites identified first-generation immigrants from the Lake Titicaca basin outside of the Tiwanaku heartland at the Peruvian site of Chen Chen. These data provide an important component to studies that demonstrated close biological relationships during the Middle horizon but could not demonstrate the direction of population movement. However, no immigrants from the Lake Titicaca basin were identified at the San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries of Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, and Solcor-3. At the sites of Tiwanaku, Tilata, Iwawe, and Kirawi, strontium isotope ratios were also variable, and demonstrate movement within the Lake Titicaca basin. This demonstrates that Tiwanaku influence involved direct colonization in the Moquegua Valley but that in other regions, like San Pedro de Atacama, local inhabitants adopted Tiwanaku-style material culture. This elucidates the complex and highly variable relationships between the Tiwanaku heartland and peripheral sites during the Middle horizon.           ,              Resumen             Aún cuando la presencia del estilo Tiwanaku está bien documentada en el sur de Perú, norte de Chile y el oeste de Bolivia, la naturaleza de esta influencia durante el horizonte Medio (500–1000 d.C.) ha sido atribuida a la expansión imperial o a las relaciones económicas y/o religiosas. Los datos obtenidos de los isótopos del estroncio de restos humanos arquelógicos procedentes de sitios de filiación Tiwanaku identificaron una primera generación de migrantes de la cuenca del Titicaca, fuera del núcleo Tiwanaku en el sitio de Chen Chen. Estos análisis muestran una cercanía biológica entre las poblaciones del horizonte Medio aunque no la dirección del flujo poblacional. Sin embargo, ningún migrante de la cuenca del lago Titicaca fue identificado en las muestras de los cementerios de Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, y Solcor-3 en San Pedro de Atacama. En los sitios de Tiwanaku, Tilata, Iwawe, y Kirawi, los datos isotópicos son también diversos e indican un movimiento interno en la cuenca del lago Titicaca. Esto demuestra que Tiwanaku influenció de manera directa la colonización del valle de Moquegua pero que en otras regiones, como San Pedro de Atacama, los habitantes locales adoptaron el estilo Tiwanaku en su cultura material. Esto aclara la compleja y altamente variable relación entre el núcleo de Tiwanaku y los sitios periféricos durante el horizonte Medio.","2008-03","2024-07-10 14:56:08","2024-07-10 14:56:08","2024-07-10 14:56:08","3-23","","1","19","","Latin Am. antiq.","Tiwanaku Influence in the South Central Andes","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dispersal patterns are a life-history variable that correlate with numerous aspects of behaviour and socio-ecology that are elusive in the fossil record. The present study demonstrates that the standard archaeological method used to differentiate between ‘local’ and ‘non-local’ individuals, which involves comparing faunal isotopic ratios with environmental isotopic minima and maxima, is not always reliable; aspects of primate behaviour, local environments, geologic heterogeneity and the availability of detailed geologic maps may compromise its utility in certain situations. This study instead introduces a different methodological approach: calculating offset values to compare               87               Sr/               86               Sr of teeth with that of bone or local environments. We demonstrate this method's effectiveness using data from five species of primates, including chimpanzees, from Kibale National Park, Uganda. Tooth-to-bone offsets reliably indicate sex-biases in dispersal for primates with small home ranges while tooth-to-environment offset comparisons are more reliable for primates with larger home ranges. Overall, tooth-to-environment offsets yield the most reliable predictions of species' sex-biases in dispersal.","2021-02","2024-07-10 14:56:28","2024-07-10 14:56:28","2024-07-10 14:56:28","rsos.200760, 200760","","2","8","","R.

A total of 22 human and 5 faunal samples analyzed for strontium isotopes reveal a narrow range of variation in values, pointing to the likely local origin of over two-thirds of the central population of Calakmul, including two of its rulers. Carbon and nitrogen data confirm a typical Classic Maya diet at the site and identify a diet high in meat consumption for one dynastic individual. Interpreted jointly, the isotopic information offers new perspectives on the provenience and lifestyles of the residents of Calakmul, including a potential place of origin for the royal occupant of chamber tomb Burial VII-1.           ,              Las investigaciones isotópicas de los entierros humanos recuperados en el centro regional Maya prehispánico de Calakmul, Mexico, durante las excavaciones a cargo del Centro de Investigaciones Históricas y Sociales de la Universidad Autónoma de Campeche incluyen fechas de radiocarbono y proporciones de isótopos de carbono y nitrógeno en colágeno, así como de isótopos de estroncio, carbono y oxígeno en esmalte dental. Se analizaron 22 muestras de restos humanos y 5 especímenes faunísticos.

Geo‐referencing based on oxygen or strontium isotopes can be misleading due to overlap with other countries in Europe and other continents. Carbon and lead isotopes, in combination with oxygen and strontium isotopes, provide the most useful information for identification of local vs foreigner status. In particular, high‐precision Pb isotopes show a distinct “Bulgarian” range; however, it is possible that individuals from other countries in Eastern Europe and/or central to western Asia could have overlapping isotopic values.

We suggest that the bioavailability of Sr in Saharan dust may be considerably less than previously thought. Nevertheless, further work could usefully be carried out in the Bahamian archipelago on plants with different rooting depths, growing on different soil types and on limestone of different ages.

Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala, was a large Prehispanic center located in a distinctly cooler, drier setting compared with the majority of Maya sites in the surrounding lowlands. Previous archaeological research at Kaminaljuyu revealed it played an important political and economic role in the Maya region, assisting in the obsidian trade network and maintaining ties with communities as far away as Teotihuacan in central Mexico. By examining the strontium (               87               Sr/               86               Sr), carbon (δ               13               C), and oxygen (δ               18               O) isotope values from dental enamel of humans and terrestrial mammals at the site, this study provides direct evidence of long-distance animal trade, explores the nature and timing of such activities, and compares highland dietary patterns with faunal studies in the lowlands. Our results indicate that isotopically non-local humans and animals are most frequently found in special and ceremonial contexts, indicating that long-distance movements of people and products were motivated for politically or ritually significant events. Although dietary patterns showed cross-species variation, diets within species were similar between highland and lowland settings.","2022-01","2024-07-10 14:57:39","2024-07-10 14:57:39","2024-07-10 14:57:39","29","","1","14","","Archaeol Anthropol Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\KFA3EHSI\Sharpe et al. - 2022 - Comparison of human and faunal enamel isotopes rev.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two problems arise in such investigations: (1) levels of strontium isotope ratios in local bedrock, soil, water, plants and animals are variable; and (2) a range of values in human bone and enamel data make it difficult to distinguish some migrants from locals. Analysis of the bones of small animals provides a robust measure of local strontium isotope ratios and a reliable, if conservative, means for determining confidence limits for distinguishing migrants. Data from various geographical areas are presented here in a discussion of variability in strontium isotope values. Examples are provided using modern and prehistoric materials.

Unfortunately, little is known about movement patterns for many species. This information is critical for evaluating vulnerability to habitat loss and the adequacy of existing or proposed protected areas. Strontium isotope ratios (                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr) in prey remains reflect the geology where individuals lived and were killed, and can be used to identify foraging ranges for predators. We tested the degree to which                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr in consumed lemurs (Lemuroidea) can be used to track foraging ranges for Henst's goshawk (                 Accipiter henstii                 ) at Ranomafana National Park (RNP), eastern Madagascar, Africa. This large‐bodied endemic accipiter is sparsely distributed and rarely observed outside of forest or at elevations >1,200 m. A geologic boundary divides lower and higher elevations at RNP: Precambrian migmatite is at lower elevations within and to the east of RNP and Precambrian metasediments are limited to higher elevations in southwestern RNP. We collected foliage from trees and understory plants to establish                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr for both geologies, and remains from 19 depredated lemurs from 4 hawk nests located along the eastern edge of RNP. Leaves from metasediments have greater                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr than leaves from migmatite.                 87                 Sr/                 86                 Sr for lemur bones suggests that 18 of the 19 predated individuals came from forests underlain by migmatite. Thus, strontium isotope data suggest that Henst's goshawk primarily hunted on migmatite at RNP, which supports a growing body of evidence that this species forages at elevations below approximately 1,200 m. Most reserves in eastern Madagascar protect forest at higher elevations. Conserving remaining forest and revegetating denuded land at lower elevations will likely be critical for survival of this species. Understanding mobility patterns is crucial for managing predator populations. Isotopic analysis of prey is a noninvasive method for monitoring foraging ranges that complements existing approaches. This geochemical tool is readily adaptable to other systems and species. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.                                       ,              Estimating foraging range is challenging for cryptic, flighted, or rare species. We used strontium isotopes in predated lemurs to investigate foraging habits for Henst's goshawks in eastern Madagascar; results bolster previous observations and suggest that goshawks do not regularly forage above 1,200 m asl.","2017-12","2024-07-10 14:58:28","2024-07-10 14:58:28","2024-07-10 14:58:28","743-751","","4","41","","Wildl.

The two main sources of Ca in forest stands are mineral weathering release and atmospheric inputs. Measurements in several forest stands in temperate regions show a steep decrease from pith to outer wood of the Sr isotope ratio from∼1870 to∼1920 except for stands developed on soils with a higher Ca status. This suggests a decrease of the weathering contribution (high               87               Sr/               86               Sr ratio) when cations are displaced from the soil exchange complex by acid deposition at a rate faster than the replenishment of the cation pool by mineral weathering. This displacement enhances the atmospheric contribution, which is characterized by a low               87               Sr/               86               Sr ratio. Tree‐ring chronologies are an exceptional historic‐timing record of chemical changes in the soil environment induced by atmospheric pollution. The reliability of the tree‐ring recorder has been verified with a well‐controlled nutritional perturbation in the context of a limed forest stand (with a known liming Sr isotopic signature).

We established the geologic basis for unique isotopic signatures in 29 salmon sites. Stream-specific Sr isotopic ratios (               87               Sr/               86               Sr) were found in calcified tissues of salmon parr within 3 months of stocking. We found little seasonal variation in the Sr signatures of stream water or fish tissue. There were no significant differences among the Sr signatures of otoliths, scales, and vertebrae. For mature salmon raised under constant conditions, 70% of the Sr isotopic signature in calcified tissues was derived from food sources. We developed a criterion for identifying moving fish based upon the isotopic variability of genetically marked fish. Applying this criterion to our streams, 7% of the fish in our study had incorporated Sr from multiple streams. Strontium isotopes distinguished all 8 regions in the White River basin and 7 of the 10 regions in the West River basin. When watersheds are considered together, Sr isotopes differentiated 11 unique signatures from 18 regions. We conclude that Sr isotopes are an effective marking tool and discuss ways in which they can be combined with other marking techniques over larger spatial scales.","2000-11-01","2024-06-05 21:30:19","2024-07-11 15:42:38","2024-07-10 15:00:27","2280-2292","","11","57","","Can.

In particular, understanding whether a migratory lifestyle is compulsory or facultative, and whether adults home to their natal geographic area is paramount to fully appraise disruptions of longitudinal connectivity resulting from damming.                                                                          In the Amazon, the large migratory catfishes of the                     Brachyplatystoma                     genus are apex predators of considerable interest for fisheries. They are believed to use the entire length of the basin to perform their life cycle, with hypothesized homing behaviours. Here, we tested these hypotheses, using the emblematic                     B. rousseauxii                     as a model species.                                                                                             We sampled adults close to major breeding areas in the Amazon basin (upper Madeira and upper Amazonas) and assessed their lifetime movements by measuring variations in                     87                     Sr/                     86                     Sr along transverse sections of their otoliths (ear stones) using laser ablation multicollector mass spectrometry (                     LA                     ‐                     MC                     ‐                     ICPMS                     ).                                                                        We demonstrate that larvae migrate downstream from the Andean piedmont to the lower Amazon, where they grow over a protracted period before migrating upstream as adults. Contrary to prevailing inferences, not all fish spend their nursery stages in the Amazon estuary. By contrast, the passage in the lower or central Amazon seems an obligate part of the life cycle. We further evidence that most adults home to their natal geographic area within the Madeira sub‐basin. Such long‐distance natal homing is exceptional in purely freshwater fishes.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     . By using otolith microchemistry, we were able to demonstrate a seemingly compulsory basin‐wide migratory life cycle of large Amazonian catfishes. This makes them the organisms performing the longest migrations (>8000 km) in fresh waters. This exceptional life history is already jeopardized by two dams recently built in the Madeira River, which block a major migration route and access to a substantial part of their spawning grounds. Major impacts can be anticipated from the current and forthcoming hydroelectric development in the Amazon basin, not only on the populations and fisheries of this apex predator, but also on Amazonian food webs through trophic cascades.                                                                           ,              By using otolith microchemistry, we were able to demonstrate a seemingly compulsory basin‐wide migratory life cycle of large Amazonian catfishes.

Most studies indicated that crocodilians do not move around much but several studies demonstrated that some species showed movement patterns. Detection of these movements along the individual life is still a challenge. In this study we analyzed the variation of strontium isotopic ratio (             87             Sr             /86             Sr) in the femur bones of 70             Caimanya care             individuals caught in 16 sites located in five hydrological sectors of the Beni river floodplain in Bolivia. Our results demonstrated for the first time that such a methodology could yield indications about the capture sites and reconstruct individual life history. Analyses of the outer part of the femur of 70 individuals showed that capture sites could be differentiated between sectors and even between sites or groups of sites in each sector. Studies of complete             87             Sr             /86             Sr profiles along the femur, representing the individual’s entire life, were performed on 33 yacares. We found that most of the individuals did not show any significant isotopic variation throughout their lives. This absence of variation could result from a high fidelity to the birth site, and/or from an insignificant isotopic variation between the water bodies through which the animal has potentially moved. However, 24% of the analyzed individuals presented significant variations that can be considered as movements between different habitats. Based on the observed low proportion of moving yacares, we advocated that each water body should be considered an individual management unit.","2021-04-14","2024-06-05 21:31:35","2024-07-11 15:43:20","2024-07-10 15:00:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Ecology","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\ATICIDDF\Pouilly et al. - 2021 - Revealing capture sites and movements by strontium.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio for individuals classified as locals ranged from 0. 70905 to 0. 71064 and was closer to the isotope ratio of the seawater than to the ratio of the terrestrial fauna, indicating a strong influence of marine strontium on the inhabitants of this sambaqui. The results indicate the existence of three non-local individuals (87Sr/86Sr = 0. 70761 to 0. 70835), buried in both the level without pottery and the layer with pottery, possibly originated from the Santa Catarina Plateau, close to the municipality of Lages, or from the Curitiba Plateau.

Differences in mortuary treatment can help approach this issue. Here, we present a multi-isotope study to track both diet and mobility through the life histories of 32 broadly coeval Late Neolithic individuals interred in caves and in megalithic graves of a restricted region of northern Iberia. The results show significant differences in infant- and child-rearing practices, in subsistence strategies, and in landscape use between burial locations. From this, we posit that the presence of communities with distinct lifestyles and cultural backgrounds is a primary reason for Late Neolithic variability in burial location in Western Europe and provides evidence of an early “them and us” scenario. We argue that this differentiation could have played a role in the building of lasting structures of socioeconomic inequality and, occasionally, violent conflict.","2020-01-24","2024-06-05 21:28:55","2024-07-11 15:41:44","2024-07-10 15:01:43","eaay2169","","4","6","","Sci.

However, little attention is paid to the relative contributions of terrestrial versus marine sources of strontium in these studies. There is some debate over the role of a solid diet versus drinking water as the most important source of strontium for the human body, with related possibilities of misinterpretation of the archaeological record if only strontium isotope compositions of the biosphere are studied. However, there is a third component, marine strontium, which is commonly not assumed to contribute towards the strontium isotope composition of archaeological skeletal remains, especially in locations that are not directly coastal. To illustrate the potentially obfuscating effects of mixed Sr sources in a human population, we present a case study of twelve individuals from the medieval Finnish site Iin Hamina with a known dietary history. Our study shows that marine consumption is a significant factor explaining the strontium isotope composition of the Iin Hamina human remains, with implication of erroneous conclusions about immigration without prior knowledge of diet composition. Thus, future studies should always incorporate a rigorous analysis of dietary history, with special regard to potential consumption of aquatic resources, when strontium isotope analysis is used as a method in the study of palaeomobility.","2021-01","2024-06-05 21:30:29","2024-07-11 15:42:46","2024-07-10 15:02:55","1","","1","13","","Archaeol Anthropol Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\JRI29CP7\Lahtinen et al. - 2021 - Source of strontium in archaeological mobility stu.pdf; C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\H264WA4B\Lahtinen et al. - 2021 - Source of strontium in archaeological mobility stu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of analytical tools to determine the origin of fishes is useful to better understand patterns of habitat use and to monitor, manage, and control fisheries, including certification of food origin. The application of isotopic analyses to study calcified structures of fishes (scales, vertebrae, and otoliths) may provide robust information about the fish geographic origin and environmental living conditions. In this study, we used Sr and C isotopic markers recorded in otoliths of wild and farmed commercialized pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) to evaluate their prediction potential to trace the fishes origin. Wild and farmed fish specimens, as well as food used for feeding pirarucu in captivity, were collected from different sites. Isotope composition of otoliths performed by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS; δ13C) and femtosecond laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LAfs-MC-ICPMS; 87Sr∕86Sr) were compared to the isotopic composition of water and of the food given to the fishes in the farms. Wild fish specimens that lived in environments with the largest fluctuation of river water Sr isotope ratios over time presented the largest Sr isotope variations in otoliths. A quadratic discriminant analysis on otolith isotopic composition provided 58 % of correct classification for fish production (wild and farmed) and 76 % of correct classification for the fish region. Classification accuracy for region varied between 100 % and 29 % for the Madeira and the Lower Amazon fishes, respectively. Overall, this preliminary trial is not yet fully developed to be applied as a commercial traceability tool. However, given the importance of Arapaima spp. for food security and the generation of economic resources for millions of people in the Amazon basin, further analyses are needed to increase the discrimination performance of these biogeographical tags.","2019-04-26","2024-06-05 21:31:18","2024-07-11 15:43:16","2024-07-10 15:03:19","1781-1797","","8","16","","Biogeosciences","Commercial traceability of &lt;i&gt;Arapaima&lt;/i&gt; spp. fisheries in the Amazon basin","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\AWTHBRLW\Pereira et al. - 2019 - Commercial traceability of &lt;i&gt;Arapaima&lt;i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since its first introduction to China in 2003, this method has greatly improved our understanding of migrations on individual- and community-scales over the past 20 years. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding identifying non-locals, utilizing animal resources, and strontium isoscapes for China based on empirical data. By incorporating additional baseline data, we updated and extended the current bioavailable strontium isoscape for China and Southeast and South Asia. These data will shed new light on intercultural communications and the spread of customs and technologies. In the future, strontium isotope analysis will involve an integrated provenancing system along with multiple approaches such as various isotopes and different modellings. Correspondingly, the existing isoscape needs to improve its spatial resolution and predictive accuracy to source the non-local archaeological biological remains. Furthermore, advances in analytical techniques allow us to reconstruct lifetime mobility of animals and humans at high temporal resolution.","2023-01-20","2024-06-05 14:57:08","2024-07-11 15:43:57","2024-07-10 15:03:34","1094424","","","10","","Front.

We also found significant interannual variability in the geochemical signatures from several rivers, due largely to differences in δ               18               O values among years. We then used the ground‐truthed geochemical signatures in the otoliths of juvenile American shad to identify the natal origins of spawning adults in the York River system in Virginia. Approximately 6% of the spawning adults collected in the York River were strays from other rivers. Of the remaining fish, 79% were spawned in the Mattaponi River and 21% in the Pamunkey River. The combined results of this and other recent studies suggest that although most American shad spawning in the York River were homing to their natal river, there was much less fidelity to individual tributaries. Small‐scale straying could allow fish spawned in the Mattaponi River to subsidize spawning in the Pamunkey River, which has experienced persistent recruitment failure.","2008-01","2024-06-05 21:33:25","2024-07-11 15:44:17","2024-07-10 15:03:45","57-69","","1","137","","Trans Am Fish Soc","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\HLRMVQGU\Walther et al. - 2008 - Geochemical Signatures in Otoliths Record Natal Or.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most such vessels known to archaeologists are part of looted collections or else were unearthed before the advent of modern archaeological practices. As a result, little is known about the context, use, and chronology of these objects. Recent investigations at the site of Palos Blancos in northwest Honduras discovered an Ulúa-style marble vase in an undisturbed mortuary context. Excavation of the burial context, along with bioarchaeological and stable isotope analysis of the human remains, suggests that the vase was placed as an offering, possibly to an ancestor of the residential group. Phosphate and pollen studies indicate that the vase once held a corn-based beverage . Radiocarbon dating of four charcoal samples from immediately below and adjacent to the vase yielded a range of dates from the beginning of the Late Classic period, ca.A.D. 600-800. Through analyses of the context and contents of the vase, this research contributes to a more holistic understanding of the use and meaning of Ulúa-style marble vases in southern Mesoamerica.           ,              Resumen             Los vasos de mármol del estilo Ulúa desempeñaron importantes papeles sociales, politicos, económicos, y religiosos en el sur de Mesoamérica durante los siglos séptimo a onceavo d.C. Sin embargo, la mayoría de dichas vasijas conocidas por los arqueológos forman parte de colecciones saqueadas ofueron desenterradas antes de la disponibilidad de prácticas arqueológicas modernas. Como resultado, se sabe muy poco sobre su contexto, uso, y cronología. Excavaciones recientes en el sitio Palos Blancos en el Valle de Palmarejo en el noroeste de Honduras descubrieron un vaso de mdrmol del estilo Ulúa en un contexto mortuorio intacto. Este trabajo reporta los resultados de los andlisis del depósito y de los contenidos del vaso, así como la datación de materias orgánicas asociadas con el hallazgo. El contexto del entierro así como los análisis bioarqueológicos y de isótopos estables de los restos humanos sugieren que el vasofue colocado como una ofrenda hecha tal vet a un ancestro del grupo residencial. Los estudios de fosfatos y del polen indican que el vaso alguna vez contuvo una bebida de maiz. La datación por radiocarbono de cuatro muestras de carbón tomadas inmediatamente debajo y adyacentes al vaso proveyó una serie defechas (cal. 2a 595 ±55, 615 ±45, 625 ±45, 705 ±65 d.C.) que corresponden principalmente al principio del período Clásico Tardío, ca. 600-800 d.C. Un espécimen en directa asociación con los restos humanos brindó una fecha de cal. 2a 495 ± 85 d.C, sugiriendo que el vaso nofue añadido al conjunto funerario hasta un siglo después del entierro initial. A través de los análisis del contexto y del contenido del vaso, esta investigation contribuye a una comprensión más completa del uso y significado de los vasos de mármol del estilo Ulúa en el sur de Mesoamérica.","2014-03","2024-06-05 21:33:41","2024-07-11 15:41:24","2024-07-10 15:03:50","82-100","","1","25","","Latin Am. antiq.","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ratios range from 0.722-0.739, and are similar to lake and stream waters in geologically similar areas.             The annual variation of the isotope ratio in two small lakes varied in the range of 0.7323-0.7339 and 0.7313-0.7325 respectively, except at ice clearing in spring when the ratio of surface water was lowered by a contribution from melting snow. Small lateral differences also exist in Lake Mälaren, probably because its complex outline hinders complete mixing of its water.             The Sr isotopic ratio variations with respect to bedrock geology suggest that a more important influence on the ratio is the mineralogic composition of the Quaternary deposits (mainly till).             The great difference between the ratios of rain water (0.709-0.710) and those of rocks in old Precambrian platforms with granitic rocks (0.720 and greater) results in waters (ground, lake and river) with ratios around 0.720-0.740. This means that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is an excellent tool in studies of hydrologic processes, such as mixing of waters and exchange reactions between water and mineral matter.","1987-02-01","2024-07-10 15:03:52","2024-07-10 15:03:52","2024-07-10 15:03:52","21-32","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr / 86Sr) are a key geochemical tracer used in a wide range of fields including archaeology, ecology, food and forensic sciences. These applications are based on the principle that the Sr isotopic ratios of natural materials reflect the sources of strontium available during their formation. A major constraint for current studies is the lack of robust reference maps to evaluate the source of strontium isotope ratios measured in the samples. Here we provide a new data set of bioavailable Sr isotope ratios for the major geologic units of France, based on plant and soil samples (Pangaea data repository doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.819142). The IRHUM (Isotopic Reconstruction of Human Migration) database is a web platform to access, explore and map our data set. The database provides the spatial context and metadata for each sample, allowing the user to evaluate the suitability of the sample for their specific study. In addition, it allows users to upload and share their own data sets and data products, which will enhance collaboration across the different research fields. This article describes the sampling and analytical methods used to generate the data set and how to use and access the data set through the IRHUM database. Any interpretation of the isotope data set is outside the scope of this publication.","2014-03-25","2024-07-10 15:03:55","2024-07-10 15:03:55","2024-07-10 15:03:55","117-122","","1","6","","Earth Syst.

The analyses of teeth from both Skateholm and Västerbjers displayed homogeneous ratios and corresponding mobility patterns, while the data from Norje Sunnansund showed larger variances with heterogenous strontium ratios and varied inter-individual mobility patterns. Correlation with the bioavailable baseline suggests that the size of the geographical areas, where human strontium ratios could have originated, was roughly comparable for all three sites. The teeth measurements were reflected within a 50-km radius of the surrounding landscape and the 25–75% data quartile matched with distances between 3 and 30 km from the sites, suggesting limited mobility ranges among aquatically dependent foragers from southernmost Sweden. By applying ethnographic analogies and site-specific contextual inferences, the results suggest that mobility ranges at Norje Sunnansund were likely not delimited by neighbouring group territories. This changed over time and an increasing territorialisation of the landscape may have influenced movement patterns and caused restrictions to the foraging activities at both Skateholm and Västerbjers.","2022-09","2024-07-10 15:04:06","2024-07-10 15:04:06","2024-07-10 15:04:06","176","","9","14","","Archaeol Anthropol Sci","Diachronic forager mobility","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\83S9PRYH\Boethius et al. - 2022 - Diachronic forager mobility untangling the Stone .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While an advanced fishery is suggested by the number of recovered fish bones, until now it has not been possible to identify the origin of the fish, or whether and how their seasonal migration was exploited. We analysed strontium isotope ratios (               87               Sr/               86               Sr) in 16 cyprinid and 8 pike teeth, which were recovered at the site, both from within the fermentation pit and from different areas outside of it, by using laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our investigation indicates three different regions of origin for the fish at the site. We find that the most commonly fermented fish, cyprinids (roach), were caught in the autumn during their seasonal migration from the Baltic Sea to the sheltered stream and lake next to the site. This is in contrast to the cyprinids from other areas of the site, which were caught when migrating from nearby estuaries and the Baltic Sea coast during late spring. The pikes from the fermentation pit were caught in the autumn as by-catch to the mainly targeted roach while moving from the nearby Baltic Sea coast. Lastly, the pikes from outside the fermentation pit were likely caught as they migrated from nearby waters in sedimentary bedrock areas to the south of the site, to spawn in early spring. Combined, these data suggest an advanced fishery with the ability to combine optimal use of seasonal fish abundance at different times of the year. Our results offer insights into the practice of delayed-return consumption patterns, provide a more complete view of the storage system used, and increase our understanding of Early Holocene sedentism among northern hunter-fisher-gatherers. By applying advanced strontium isotope analyses to archaeological material integrated into an ecological setting, we present a methodology that can be used elsewhere to enhance our understanding of the otherwise elusive indications of storage practices and fish exploitation patterns among ancient foraging societies.","2021-01-20","2024-07-10 15:04:12","2024-07-10 15:04:12","2024-07-10 15:04:12","e0245222","","1","16","","PLoS ONE","Early Holocene Scandinavian foragers on a journey to affluence","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\chris\Zotero\storage\4TC6DC7G\Boethius et al. - 2021 - Early Holocene Scandinavian foragers on a journey .pdf","","","","Drucker, Dorothée","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is based on the interdisciplinary study of human remains from archaeological cemeteries in the Andean Uspallata Valley (Argentina), located in the southern frontier of the Inka Empire. The studied samples span AD 800–1500, encompassing the highly dynamic Late Intermediate Period and culminating with the imperial expansion. Our research combines a macro-regional study of human paleomobility and migration based on a new strontium isoscape across the Andes that allows identifying locals and migrants, a geometric morphometric analysis of cranio-facial morphology suggesting separate ancestral lineages, and a paleodietary reconstruction based on stable isotopes showing that the migrants had diets exceptionally high in C               4               plants and largely based on maize agriculture. Significantly, this migration influx occurred during a period of regional demographic increase and would have been part of a widespread period of change in settlement patterns and population movements that preceded the Inka expansion.

For more than four decades, isotope analysis has been employed in archeological studies to explore past human and animal dietary habits, mobility patterns, and the environment in which a human or animal inhabited during life. These analyses require consideration of ethical issues. While theoretical concepts are discussed, we focus on practical aspects: working with descendant communities and other rights holders, choosing methods, creating and sharing data, and working mindfully within academia. These layers of respect and care should surround our science. This paper is relevant for specialists in isotope analysis as well as those incorporating these methods into larger projects. By covering the whole of the research process, from design to output management, we appeal broadly to archaeology and provide actionable solutions that build on the discussions in the general field.","2024-07","2024-07-10 22:08:00","2024-07-10 22:08:00","2024-07-10 22:08:00","e24992","","","","","American Journal of Biological Anthropology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
